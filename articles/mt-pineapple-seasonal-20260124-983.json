  "body": "Okay so it’s winter. My knuckles were cracking. Like, actually cracking open. I’d wash my hands and it felt like tiny paper cuts all over. Gross. I was just sitting there, looking at them under the kitchen light—that weird yellow bulb that makes everything look worse—and I thought, wow, my hands look like a lizard’s. A sad, dry lizard. That’s the physical sensation. This tight, itchy feeling, like your skin is two sizes too small. And your face? Forget it. Flaky patches near my eyebrows, this general feeling of being… parched. All the time. So I’m staring at my lizard hands, and I remember this jar of whipped tallow balm I bought on a whim. The pineapple one. Beef tallow skincare. Sounded absolutely bizarre. But my skin was in full winter mutiny, and I was desperate.\n\nI’d tried everything before this. The thick drugstore creams in the tub. The fancy lotions that cost way too much and smelled like a department store. They’d sit on top of my skin, all greasy, and five minutes later I’d be itchy again. Or they’d burn because my skin barrier was just gone. It was a whole thing. I was about to just wear gloves 24/7. And then this tallow balm showed up. I got it from this little Etsy shop, just a maker in France doing their thing. The jar said “Whipped Tallow Balm - Pineapple” and promised a tropical escape. In January. I was skeptical. Beef fat on my face? To smell like vacation? Sure.\n\n## Why I Even Tried Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nLook, I get it. It sounds weird. My first thought was, “I’m gonna smell like a kitchen.” But then I read a bit—don’t worry, I didn’t “delve” or anything, I just skimmed—and it made a weird kind of sense. This stuff is made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up. They say it mimics human skin sebum. So it’s like… giving your skin back what the winter air steals. It’s not a foreign chemical. It’s just fat. Our bodies know what to do with it. Good for dry skin, they said. For psoriasis. For chapped lips. I figured my lizard hands qualified as an emergency.\n\nThe texture threw me at first. I opened the jar. It’s not like lotion. It’s solid but soft. You scoop a tiny bit and it melts immediately from your body heat. Cold at first. Then it just vanishes. That was the wild part. I rubbed it into my cracking knuckles, expecting grease. But it sank in. Like, actually absorbed. No residue. My hands just felt… normal. Not greasy. Not sticky. Just like skin, but hydrated skin. I sat there for a minute just making fists, waiting for the slick feeling. It never came. That’s when I got curious enough to try it on my face.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nSo the scent. “Tropical escape, summer vibes.” Right. In my freezing apartment. I sniffed the jar. It doesn’t smell like fake pineapple candy. Thank god. It’s sweeter, fruitier. Cheerful. It smells like… the idea of a beach. Or maybe a really good sunscreen from when you were a kid. It’s not strong. You put it on and you get a whiff of something sunny, and then it’s gone. It’s a mood. A vacation feeling in a jar, which is frankly hilarious when you’re wearing three layers and can see your breath inside.\n\nMy routine now? It’s stupid simple. After I shower at night—when the hot water has sucked every last bit of moisture out of me—I grab the jar. I take a tiny dab, warm it between my fingers, and just press it into my face. Especially the dry patches. Then I do my hands. My elbows, which are always a disaster. Sometimes my lips if they’re bad. It’s the last step. It’s not a 10-step thing. It’s one thing. And it works.\n\nThe unrelated observation: doing this makes me notice how loud my fridge is. It hums this specific tone. And my cat judges me from the doorway. Every night. She watches me smear this stuff on and her look says, “Really? Beef fat?” But she also tries to lick my legs after I put lotion on, so her opinion is invalid.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI didn’t expect a miracle. But honestly? The cracks on my knuckles healed. Like, closed up. No more stinging when I use hand sanitizer. The flaky patches on my face? Gone. My skin just feels… calm. Even. It doesn’t have that tight, screaming feeling when I go outside. I was walking to my car the other morning, wind blowing, and I braced for that instant dry-skin ache. It never came. My face just felt like my face. It was weird. A good weird.\n\nIs it a magical fountain of youth? No. I still look tired because I stay up too late watching bad TV. But my skin isn’t adding to the problem. It’s not angry. It’s just… there. Being skin. For winter skincare, that’s a huge win. Dry winter skin usually runs my life from November to March. This year, it’s just a background character. I’m probably gonna order another jar soon because I use it every day. I even got one for my mom, who has psoriasis on her hands. She called me last week and said, “What is this pineapple goop? It’s helping.” I didn’t know what to say. I just said, “I know, right?”\n\nIt’s not that it’s glamorous. It’s sitting in a simple jar on my dresser next to some loose change and a hair tie. But it’s the one thing that’s actually helped my seasonal skin struggles. Tallow balm for winter just… makes sense. It’s like giving your skin a sweater made of its own stuff.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. The idea is it’s really similar to the oils our skin already makes. So it absorbs deep instead of sitting on top. It’s not for everyone, but if your skin is dry or irritated, it can help a lot. My face likes it way more than the fancy acid serums I used to use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores. Because it mimics sebum, my skin seems to know what to do with it. It sinks in. It doesn’t feel like it’s blocking anything. If anything, my skin feels more balanced, less like it needs to overproduce oil.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s sweet. Fruity. But not like a Jolly Rancher. It’s more like the smell of a pineapple when you first cut into it, mixed with just… a clean, sunny smell. It’s cheerful. It doesn’t stick around long, just a nice little scent when you apply it.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult this winter, and the usual stuff isn’t cutting it, this might be worth a shot. I was skeptical too. But it just works. I don’t know what else to say. My elbows haven’t been this smooth in years.",
