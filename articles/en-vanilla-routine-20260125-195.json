  "title": "That Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm I Can't Stop Using",
  "body": "Okay so it’s like 10 PM and I’m just sitting here. My phone’s at 12%. The heater’s making that weird clicking noise it does. And I just smeared this beef fat stuff on my face. Sounds insane, right? That’s what I thought. But this bourbon vanilla tallow balm thing? It’s weirdly become the only part of my routine I actually look forward to. Especially now, in winter. My skin was just… angry. Tight. Flaky in a way that made my foundation look like a dried-up riverbed. I was using this expensive cream from that fancy store in the mall. The one in the heavy jar. Did nothing. Felt like I was just moving flakes around. So I was scrolling Etsy one night, probably procrastinating, and saw this whipped tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I almost closed the tab. But the reviews were all these normal people saying it fixed their dry skin. And it was the bourbon vanilla scent that got me. Sounded cozy. I was skeptical. So, so skeptical. But my knuckles were cracking. So I got it.\n\n## How This Beef Tallow Routine Actually Goes Down\n\nMy jar’s on my nightstand. Next to a pile of books I won’t read and an empty water glass. It’s this little glass thing. Looks homemade. I use it at night, mostly. Right after I wash my face, which I do with this cheap drugstore cleanser because I’m not fancy. My face is still a little damp. Not wet, just… damp. I scoop out a tiny bit with my finger. Like, the size of a pea. Maybe a little less. It’s cold when you first get it. Solid but soft. You have to warm it up between your fingers. It melts fast. Then I just pat it on. Cheeks first. Forehead. Chin. The whole thing.\n\nHere’s the weird part—it doesn’t feel greasy. Not like you’d think. It just sinks in. My skin drinks it. It feels… I don’t know. Thirsty. Like it was waiting for this. I used to put on that other cream and my face would feel like it had a film on it for hours. This? Gone in a few minutes. But my skin feels calm. Not tight. Not shiny. Just normal. Like skin is supposed to feel, maybe. I’ll do my hands too if they’re bad. Just rub whatever’s left on my fingers into my knuckles. And my lips. I put it on my lips before bed. Woke up once and my cat was just staring at the jar. Probably confused. Anyway.\n\nSometimes I use it in the morning if I’m not going anywhere. Or if it’s really cold out. Just a tiny, tiny bit under my eyes and on my cheeks before I put on sunscreen. It makes my makeup sit better. Doesn’t pill. I don’t know the science. I just know it works.\n\n## Why Putting Animal Fat on Your Face Isn't That Crazy\n\nI looked this up after I bought it because I felt weird. Tallow is basically rendered beef fat. From grass-fed cows. This one’s made in France, apparently. They whip it so it gets this fluffy texture. It’s not gritty or gross. It’s smooth. But the reason it works, from what I read, is that it’s really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So your skin recognizes it. It absorbs deep instead of just sitting on top like a lot of mineral oil-based stuff. It’s like giving your skin back what the winter air and harsh soaps steal from it. That’s the theory, anyway. All I know is my skin stopped freaking out. The flakiness on my nose and between my eyebrows? Gone in like, four days. My hands don’t look like a lizard’s anymore. It’s good for sensitive skin because it’s just one ingredient, basically. Beef fat and then essential oils for scent. No crazy chemical preservatives or fragrance. My sister has eczema and I told her to try it. She was horrified at first. Then she texted me a week later like “okay what’s the website.”\n\nI got mine from this small shop on Etsy. The seller was nice. Answered my weird question about shelf life super fast. It feels good to buy from a person, not a factory.\n\n## What Happened After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been maybe a month now. Maybe six weeks. I lost track. The jar is about half empty. I’m already thinking I need to order another one before I run out. That’s the real test, right? If you re-buy it.\n\nMy routine is different now. It’s simpler. I don’t have five different serums and creams lined up. I wash my face. I put on this tallow balm. That’s it. Sometimes I use a vitamin C serum in the morning if I remember. But the tallow is the constant. The anchor. My skin just feels… balanced. Not oily. Not dry. Just balanced. I had this dry patch on my elbow for literally years. I tried everything. Lotions, exfoliating, coconut oil. Nothing. I started putting a dab of this tallow on it at night. It’s gone. Smooth. I don’t get it.\n\nThe scent is the other thing. Bourbon vanilla. It doesn’t smell like dessert. It’s not sweet. It’s warm. Like vanilla beans and maybe a little wood. Something deep. It’s not strong. You smell it when you open the jar and when you’re applying it, and then it fades. It’s just comforting. Makes the whole process feel like a tiny ritual. Not a chore. My bathroom smells like it now. In a good way.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. It sounds wild, but it makes sense. It’s similar to our skin’s natural oils, so it absorbs really well and doesn’t just clog stuff up. It’s like superfood for your skin barrier, especially if you’re dry or sensitive.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m kinda prone to clogged pores. Because it’s so similar to our own sebum, it seems to balance things out instead of blocking them. It absorbs deep. It doesn’t leave a pore-clogging film like some heavy creams do.\n\n**What does bourbon vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s warm. Cozy. Not like a cake. More like real vanilla beans with a deep, almost smoky note. It’s not overpowering. You smell it when you use it and then it just… goes away. It’s nice. Makes it feel less clinical.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow balm routine. It’s not complicated. I scoop a little out, warm it up, pat it on. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. For someone who was super skeptical about putting rendered beef fat on my face, I’ve become that person who tells friends about it. If your skin’s feeling rough this winter, it might be worth a weird shot. I don’t know what else to say. It just works.",
