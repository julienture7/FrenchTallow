  "body": "Okay so I’m sitting here, it’s like 9 PM on a Tuesday, and my face feels like it’s made of paper. The heat’s been blasting all day. My hands look like a dried-up riverbed. You know the feeling. Anyway, I just smeared this whipped tallow balm all over my face. The pear one. It’s this stuff I got on Etsy a few weeks back because I was desperate. Beef fat for your skin. Sounds insane, right? I thought it was gonna be greasy and smell like a barn. But it’s not. It’s… fine. Actually it’s better than fine. My skin’s just stopped freaking out. That’s the whole story.\n\nI was using this fancy cream before. Sixty bucks. Felt like nothing. My cheeks were still tight and red. So I’m scrolling, it’s midnight, my cat’s walking on the keyboard, and I see this tallow skincare stuff. Grass-fed beef suet. Whipped. From France. I almost closed the tab. But the reviews were all like “my psoriasis cleared up” and “my kid’s eczema is gone” and I’m sitting there with my sad, sensitive skin thinking… what’s the worst that could happen.\n\nSo I bought it.\n\n## How This Beef Tallow Thing Ended Up on My Nightstand\n\nIt arrived in a little box. The jar was smaller than I thought. For some reason I pictured a tub. It’s not a tub. It’s a jar. The label was simple. I opened it and poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter that’s been whipped with a mixer for a really long time. Super light. I put a tiny bit on my finger. It melted. Like immediately. Into nothing. I was expecting grease. This was… not that.\n\nThe smell. They said pear. I was worried it would be like a Jolly Rancher. It’s not. It’s like if you walked past a pear tree. Once. On a cool day. You get a little sweetness. Then it’s just… clean. Fresh. I don’t know how to describe it. My roommate walked in and said “what’s that smell, it’s nice” and I had to say “it’s cow fat” and she just stared at me.\n\nBut here’s the thing about using a tallow balm routine. You can’t use a lot. That was my first mistake. I globbed it on like my old moisturizer. Big mistake. A little goes so, so far. Like a dab the size of a pea for my whole face. Now I just use my ring finger, get a tiny scoop, warm it between my fingers, and pat it on. It sinks in. Actually sinks. Doesn’t just sit there.\n\n## My Actual Daily Skincare with Tallow (When I Remember)\n\nMy routine is a mess. I’m not a skincare person. I forget. But this stuff I remember because my skin literally tells me when I forget. It starts feeling tight around 3 PM.\n\nSo in the morning, I wash my face with water. Just water. Sometimes if I shower, the steam is enough. Then, while my face is still a little damp, I do the pea-sized amount of the tallow balm. That’s it. I read somewhere that tallow mimics your skin’s own… sebum? Is that the word? Yeah. So it gets absorbed deep. It doesn’t just coat you. It becomes part of the whole… skin situation. I put it on my dry patches around my nose. My knuckles. Anywhere that’s looking rough.\n\nAt night is when I go for it. After I wash my face—actually I use that cheap Cerave cleanser, the green one—I’ll do a slightly bigger scoop. Maybe two peas. My skin drinks it up. I put it on my elbows too. They were so ashy. Like sandpaper. Now they’re… normal. It’s bizarre.\n\nThe best use, though, is as an overnight mask. Once a week, maybe on a Sunday when I’m just watching TV, I’ll put a thicker layer on. Just sit there with my shiny face. It doesn’t feel heavy. It feels… secure. Like my skin can finally relax. I wake up and it’s all gone. And my face is soft. Not “product” soft. Just soft. Like it used to be before I turned 30 and winter became my enemy.\n\nI got sidetracked. My neighbor’s TV is super loud. Some game show. Annoying.\n\nAnyway, how to use tallow balm. Less is more. Warm it up. Put it on damp skin. That’s the secret. Don’t be scared of it.\n\n## What Actually Happened After a Few Weeks\n\nI didn’t take pictures. I should have. But I didn’t believe it would work. The change was slow. Then one day I was putting on foundation—which I hardly do—and it didn’t cling to any dry spots. It just went on smooth. I was like… huh.\n\nThen my mom visited. She has this super sensitive skin, rosacea, the whole deal. She used my tallow balm one night because she forgot her cream. The next morning she was like “what is that stuff.” I told her. She made a face. Then she said “my face doesn’t hurt.” She ordered a jar that afternoon. From the same little Etsy shop I used.\n\nThat’s when I knew it wasn’t just me.\n\nMy daily skincare with tallow now is just… automatic. It’s the thing I reach for. The $60 cream is in the back of the cabinet. Probably expired. This little jar of whipped beef fat is front and center. It’s half empty. I need to order another one soon.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly. From what I get, it’s similar to the oils our skin makes naturally. So your skin recognizes it and knows what to do with it. It’s not like putting mineral oil or something weird on there. It just… works with you. My sensitive skin hasn’t reacted at all, which is a miracle.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was terrified of this. I’m prone to little breakouts. But no, it hasn’t for me. Because it absorbs properly, it doesn’t just sit on top and block everything. It’s the opposite. My skin feels balanced. Less oily during the day, actually.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s not a strong perfume. It’s a light, fresh smell. Like the idea of a pear. Not candy. More like the skin of a ripe pear, but subtle. It fades pretty fast after you put it on. Mostly you just smell… nothing. Which is good.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my thing. If your skin is being difficult, especially in this dry winter air, this might be worth a shot. I was super skeptical. Now I’m just… not. I’m probably gonna order another jar next week. My elbows haven’t been this normal-looking in years. I don’t know what else to say. It just works.",
