  "title": "Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm: The Weird Jar That Fixed My Winter Face",
  "body": "Okay so my skin is just… the worst. In winter. It’s not even a skin type, it’s a whole situation. It’s like, dry but also gets weird little bumps? And red patches by my nose that feel tight. Like if you stretched a balloon over sandpaper. That’s the vibe. I’ve tried everything. The expensive stuff in the blue bottle from the mall, the drugstore lotion that smells like flowers and chemicals, the “clean” cream that cost like eighty dollars and did absolutely nothing. My bathroom cabinet is a graveyard of things that promised to fix me. Nothing worked. It all just sat on top, made me feel greasy, or vanished in five minutes leaving me back at square one. So I was scrolling one night, my heater was making that clicking noise it does, and my cheeks were so tight it hurt to smile. I saw this thing about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I mean, come on. That sounds like something your weird homesteading aunt would make. But the person talking about it had skin that looked… calm. Not shiny. Just normal. I was desperate. And a little tipsy on a Tuesday, if I’m being honest. I ordered the Bourbon Vanilla one from this little Etsy shop. Figured if I was gonna smear cow fat on myself, it should at least smell good.\n\n**How I Even Got to Putting Beef Tallow on My Face**\n\nLook. The logic, when I finally read it, made a stupid amount of sense. Our skin makes sebum, right? Oils. Tallow from grass-fed cows is apparently really close to that. Closer than plant oils or whatever synthetic junk is in most moisturizers. So it doesn’t just sit there—it actually gets absorbed. My brain went, “Huh.” But my other brain was still like, “You bought a jar of whipped beef fat. You are now that person.” It arrived in this simple jar. No crazy packaging. I opened it. It smelled like… vanilla. But not cake vanilla. Like, vanilla that’s been somewhere. Warm. Cozy. Not sweet. I poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It was solid but soft, like cold butter, but then it melted the second my finger warmed it up. I was standing in my kitchen, my cat giving me that judgmental look from the top of the fridge. I thought, “Well, I paid for it.” I put a tiny bit on the back of my hand. It melted in. Like, actually in. No residue. My hand felt… normal. Not greasy. Not sticky. Just like my hand, but happier. So I took a deep breath and put some on my face.\n\n**What This Bourbon Vanilla Stuff Actually Does**\n\nThe first night, I just used it on the super dry patches. My elbows, too, because why not. The smell is the first thing you notice. It’s not a perfume. It’s just this comforting, warm vanilla smell that doesn’t scream “HI I’M WEARING SCENT.” It’s quiet. It made my whole bedtime routine feel kind of fancy, in a low-key way. Like I was doing something special for myself, not just slapping on product. I woke up and my patches were… softer. Not healed, but less angry. Less of that sandpaper feel. So I kept using it. Morning and night. A tiny scoop, warm it between my fingers, press it into my skin. Don’t rub it around like lotion, just press. It sinks in. Here’s the weird part: my skin stopped feeling like it was thirsty all the time. That tight, pulling feeling after I washed my face? Gone. The little flaky bits around my eyebrows? Gone. And the weird bumpy texture on my forehead just… smoothed out. I don’t know how else to say it. I wasn’t expecting that at all. I was just hoping not to look like a lizard. I got more than I bargained for. My foundation started sitting better. Everything just looked… more even. I started using it on my hands after washing dishes, too. They haven’t cracked once this winter. That’s huge for me.\n\n**My Skin Now, After a Few Weeks of This Jar**\n\nI’m almost out. I’ve been using it for maybe six weeks? I need to order another one. That’s the real review, right? If you use it up and immediately think about getting more. My skin isn’t “perfect”—I still get a stress pimple, I still have pores. But the winter drama? The redness, the Sahara-desert dryness, the irritation? Managed. It’s just calm. It feels resilient. Like I can go outside in the cold wind and my face isn’t going to stage a mutiny. I used to layer three different products and still feel dry. Now I just use this tallow balm. That’s it. Sometimes if I’m feeling extra, I’ll put a serum underneath. But it doesn’t need it. I told my mom about it, who has super sensitive skin and psoriasis. She was skeptical too (“Beef fat, really?”) but she tried mine and texted me a week later asking for the link. She said the patches on her arms are way less itchy. That’s a bigger deal than my face, honestly. Seeing it work for her too.\n\n**Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?**\n\nYeah. Obviously. I’m literally about to click over to Etsy and get another jar. Maybe two, so I don’t run out. It’s one of those things that seems too simple to work. But it does. It’s not magic. It’s not going to make you look 20 again. But if your skin is stressed, dry, sensitive, or just generally pissed off at the winter weather, this stuff helps it chill out. It’s a natural moisturizer that actually moisturizes. Deeply. For hours. It’s the best tallow I’ve tried for just… quieting everything down. My skin feels like skin, not a problem I have to solve. After years of trying complicated routines and expensive bottles, that’s kind of a miracle.\n\n**Quick Questions I Get Asked**\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s similar to the oils our own skin makes, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just coat the surface. It’s like giving your skin something it actually recognizes and can use. My face agrees, anyway.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this. My skin can get congested. But this hasn’t clogged mine at all. It absorbs so completely that there’s nothing left to sit in pores. It’s not like putting Vaseline on. It’s different. Sinks right in.\n\n**What does the Bourbon Vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s warm. Like vanilla extract, but deeper. Not sugary. It’s cozy and subtle—you smell it when you put it on, but it doesn’t linger as a scent on your skin. It just makes the whole process feel nice.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, or if you’re just tired of products that don’t deliver, this might be worth a shot. It was for me. I got mine from “PureNaturelleSkincare” on Etsy. No one’s paying me to say that. I’m just a person with a jar of cow fat who finally stopped itching. So yeah. It just works.",
