  "title": "Okay. Let's try this. My phone's at 23%. The TV's on but it's just some cooking show. I'm drinking a beer. It's a Tuesday, I think. Maybe Wednesday. Doesn't matter.",
  "body": "So. I got this thing. A tallow balm. A lavender tallow balm, specifically. Beef fat in a jar. For your face. I know. It sounds like something you'd find in a pioneer's cabin, next to the lard. I ordered it on a whim from this Etsy shop. It was winter, my skin was doing that tight, itchy, flaky thing it does when the heat's on all day, and I was tired of spending fifty bucks on fancy creams that made my face feel like it was wrapped in plastic. This was cheaper. And weird. I like weird.\n\nIt arrived in a little box. I opened it at the kitchen counter. The fridge was humming that low hum it does. I pulled out the jar. Small. Glass. The stuff inside was white and looked... whipped. Like buttercream frosting, but not shiny. Just matte and thick. I unscrewed the lid.\n\n## What This Lavender Tallow Balm Actually Smells Like\n\nThe smell hit me. Not in a bad way. It wasn't perfume-y. It wasn't like a candle store exploded. It was like... okay. You know how lavender in stuff is usually so strong it smells like cleaning products? Or like sweet candy? This wasn't that. It was herbal. But quiet. Like if you crushed a lavender plant between your fingers, but you were outside, and there was dirt and air mixed in. It smelled real. Not \"fresh\" or \"clean\" in that fake way. Just... plant-like. Earthy. A little bit like the inside of an old wooden drawer where someone kept dried flowers. A long time ago.\n\nI poked it with my finger. Cold. The texture was weird. Solid but soft. I scooped a tiny bit—it's thick, you don't need much—and rubbed it between my palms. It melted. Instantly. Went from this waxy balm to this silky oil. But not oily oily. I don't know. It just disappeared into my skin. My hands felt... good. Not greasy. Just not dry anymore. Like they'd had a drink.\n\nI looked at my face in the microwave door reflection. Red patches. Peeling by my nose. What the hell. I smoothed some on my cheeks.\n\n## Why I Put Beef Tallow on My Face Now\n\nHere's the thing. I was skeptical. Beef tallow? For skin? It sounds medieval. But then I read a bit, after I bought it, because I'm an idiot who does research backwards. Turns out tallow—this is the grass-fed, whipped kind from France, according to the shop—is kinda similar to the oils our own skin makes. Sebum. So it absorbs. Like, really absorbs. It doesn't just sit on top and pretend to do something. It sinks in. My skin drank it up. That first night, my face just felt... calm. Not sticky. Not tight. Just normal. Neutral. I didn't look shiny. I just looked like I had skin instead of parchment paper.\n\nMy routine is a mess. Sometimes I wash my face with water. Sometimes with a cleanser from the drugstore that was on sale. At night, in the winter, I'd slather on whatever thick cream I had. They'd pill. Or sting. Or feel gross. This lavender tallow balm became my thing. After I shower, when my skin is still damp. Or right before bed. The ritual of it. The smell. It's become this little signal. A signal that the day is done. The computer is off. The emails can wait. It's just me, this quiet herbal smell, and my face getting some actual help.\n\nIt's not magic. It's not going to make you look twenty again. But my skin stopped freaking out. The red patches? Gone in like, four days. The flakiness? History. My hands get destroyed in winter—cracks, bleeding, the whole deal. I started using this on my knuckles. On my elbows. Those desert-elbows are gone now. It's just skin. It's wild. I'm on my second jar. I got one for my mom too, she has that sensitive skin that everything irritates, and she texted me last week like \"what is this wizardry.\" I didn't know what to say. It's beef fat and lavender. From an Etsy shop. It just works.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it's been a few months maybe. Winter's still here. The air is dry. My skin isn't. That's the whole review right there. I don't have a dramatic before-and-after. I just don't think about my skin anymore. It's not a problem to be solved. It's just... there. Being fine. Sometimes I use the balm in the morning if it's really cold out. It sits under my sunscreen just fine. No pilling. Mostly I use it at night. The lavender scent thing—it's not a sleeping pill. But it's calming. It's a cue. Smell that, brain? We're clocking out. Time to stare at the ceiling and think about that awkward thing you said in 2012. But with softer skin.\n\nI keep the jar on my nightstand. The little glass jar. It feels solid. Substantial. Not like some plastic tube from a mega-corporation. It feels like someone made it. Which they did. Some person in France, whipping grass-fed beef tallow and mixing in real lavender. That's kinda cool. Weird, but cool.\n\nOh, and my lips. I forgot. Chapped lips were a constant thing. I'd have five different lip balms. Now I just dab a tiny, tiny bit of this on. Healed. Overnight. It's so simple it's stupid.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, apparently. It sounds gross but it makes sense. It's similar to the oils our skin already produces, so it absorbs well and doesn't just clog stuff up. It's like giving your skin something it actually recognizes. My sensitive skin loves it, which shocked me.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot for me, and I'm prone to that. It absorbs. It doesn't sit there like a greasy mask. It feels more like it melts in and hydrates from within. If you use too much, yeah, you might feel it. But a little goes a long, long way.\n\n**What does this lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like actual lavender. Not perfume lavender. Not candy lavender. Like the plant. Herbal, earthy, a little bit green. It's gentle. It's not overpowering at all. It just smells... nice. And real.\n\nAnyway. Look. If your skin is being difficult with the dry air, or if you're just tired of complicated products that don't deliver, this natural lavender skincare thing might be worth a shot. This scented tallow balm review is just me saying: I was skeptical, I tried it, and now it's the only thing on my nightstand. I'll probably order another jar soon. Just in case.\n\nMy beer's empty. The cooking show is making dough. I should go to bed. My face feels good. That's it. That's the whole story.",
