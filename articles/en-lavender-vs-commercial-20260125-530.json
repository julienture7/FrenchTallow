  "title": "This Lavender Tallow Balm Is Weird. My Skin Loves It.",
  "body": "Okay. So I’m just gonna talk about this beef tallow balm I’ve been using. The lavender one. It sounds insane, I know. Putting cow fat on your face. But my skin was so mad at me this winter, and nothing from the store was working, and I was desperate. I’m talking about that big blue tub of Cerave. Everyone swears by it. My dermatologist friend told me to get it. So I did. And for like, two weeks, my face felt okay. Not great. Just okay. Then it started feeling tight again. Like that weird, plastic-y tightness where you smile and your cheeks feel like they might crack. I was putting more on, drinking a ton of water, and still. My hands were worse. All the cracks by my thumbs. It was brutal. So I was scrolling Etsy one night, probably 11 PM, avoiding actual work, and I saw this stuff. Whipped tallow balm. From France. Grass-fed. Lavender scent for sleep. I was skeptical. So skeptical. But I clicked buy. And honestly? It’s the only thing that’s fixed my winter skin. I don’t know how else to say it.\n\n## How I Gave Up on the Drugstore Stuff\n\nLook. I’ve tried them all. The Neutrogena Hydro Boost. The La Roche-Posay Lipikar. The fancy Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream that my sister gave me for my birthday. That one was like fifty bucks. Felt nice going on. Smelled clean. Did nothing. Absolutely nothing for the dry, flaky patches on my forehead and around my nose. It was like my skin just ate it and was still hungry. Or thirsty. Whatever. My routine was a whole production. Cleanse, tone, serum, moisturizer, maybe an oil. My bathroom counter looked like a CVS exploded. And I was still waking up with skin that felt like parchment paper. It was frustrating. And expensive. And dumb. The final straw was my hands. I’d wash them, put on that O’Keeffe’s Working Hands cream—the one in the green tub—and ten minutes later, they’d be dry again. The cracks near my knuckles would sting every time I used hand sanitizer. Which is all the time. I was over it.\n\nSo the tallow balm showed up. In a little glass jar. It looked… simple.\n\n## What Using Beef Tallow on Your Face Is Actually Like\n\nHere’s the thing. You open the jar. And it smells like lavender. But not like a Glade plugin or cheap body wash lavender. It’s like… herbal. Grounded. Maybe a little earthy underneath? I’m bad at describing scents. It’s not sweet. It’s calming. Like if a quiet garden was a smell. The texture threw me. I was expecting grease. Like bacon grease. It’s not that. It’s whipped. So it’s this really light, almost fluffy cream. You scoop a tiny bit—seriously, a pea-sized amount for your whole face—and it melts the second it touches your skin. Cold at first. Then it just sinks in. It doesn’t sit on top. It doesn’t feel like a mask. You don’t look shiny. You just feel… moisturized. But from the inside out. I read later that’s because tallow is really similar to the oils our own skin makes. The sebum. So it absorbs like it belongs there. Unlike the Cetaphil lotion that always felt like it was just politely hanging out on the surface before evaporating.\n\nI started using it at night. After I wash my face. Just that. No serums, no toners. Just the tallow balm. The first week, I didn’t notice a huge change. But my skin didn’t feel tight when I woke up. That was new. By the second week, the flaky patches were just… gone. My complexion evened out. No more random red spots. My hands healed. The cracks closed up. I’d put a thick layer on my hands before bed with some cotton gloves. Game changer. I used it on my elbows too. They haven’t been this smooth since I was a kid. Maybe never.\n\n## My Skin Now vs. Then (It’s Not Even Close)\n\nI’m about a month in. I’m on my second jar. I bought one for my mom, who has psoriasis on her elbows. She called me last week to say it’s the only thing that’s given her relief. That’s huge.\n\nThe difference between this and commercial skincare, for me, comes down to one thing: it works with my skin, not against it. All those store products have a million ingredients. Water is first. Then a bunch of emulsifiers, preservatives, silicones to make it feel silky, fragrance. They’re designed to feel good in the bottle and for five minutes on your hand. Not to actually fix a moisture barrier that’s been wrecked by winter wind and dry heat and stress. Tallow is simple. It’s one ingredient, plus the essential oil for scent. It’s food for your skin. It sounds crunchy. I get it. I was the biggest skeptic. But the proof is literally on my face.\n\nI was watching TV the other night, some baking show, and I reached up to scratch my cheek absentmindedly. And I stopped. Because my cheek was just… smooth. Soft. Not a flake in sight. I hadn’t even thought about my skin all day. That hadn’t happened in years. I used to be constantly aware of it—feeling dry, planning my next moisturizer application. Now I just put this stuff on at night and forget about it. It’s freedom.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly, it is. From what I understand, the fat molecules are really close to what our skin produces naturally. So it gets absorbed deep instead of sitting on top. It doesn’t clog pores because your skin recognizes it. It’s like giving your skin what it’s already trying to make.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m kinda prone to clogged pores. The whipped version is so light and it absorbs completely. It’s not pore-clogging grease. It’s more like a super nutrient-dense moisturizer. If you’re worried, just use a tiny amount.\n\n**What does the lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a real lavender smell. Not fake or perfume-y. It’s herbal and calm. Like a dried lavender bundle. It’s not overpowering at all. Fades pretty quickly after you put it on, but it’s really nice right before bed. Very relaxing.\n\nAnyway. If you’ve tried everything and your skin is still being difficult, this might be worth a shot. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it in France. I don’t know the rules about linking stuff here, but if you search for whipped tallow balm lavender, it’ll probably come up. It just works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy, I’m not wasting money on ten different products, and I’m probably gonna order a third jar soon just to have as backup.",
