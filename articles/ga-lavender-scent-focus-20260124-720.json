  "body": "Okay. So. I’m writing this on my phone, one cup of tea in, and my left foot is asleep because I’ve been sitting on it weird. The heating just clicked on. Right. The thing is, I got this jar of tallow balm a while back. Beef tallow balm. It sounded… well, it sounded gross. Putting beef fat on my face? I’m not a pioneer. But my skin in winter is a disaster. Flaky, tight, angry. Like it’s personally offended by the cold. I’d tried the expensive stuff from the fancy shops, the ones in the glass bottles that cost more than my weekly shop. Nothing. It just sat there. Or made things worse.\n\nSo I caved. I ordered this **Whipped Tallow Balm with lavender** from some small Etsy shop. Made in France, apparently. Grass-fed beef suet, whipped up. The whole thing. I figured, worst case, I’d waste a few quid and have a funny story. A **natural lavender skincare** experiment gone wrong.\n\nThe jar arrived. Small. Simple. I opened it.\n\n## Cad a Bhí Ann? (What Was In It?)\n\nIt didn’t look like much. Just this off-white, kind of creamy-waxy stuff. I poked it. It was firm but soft, like cold butter you’ve left out for a bit. Then I smelled it.\n\nRight, this is where I struggle. I’m not good at scent descriptions. It’s not “perfume” lavender. Not the strong, soapy kind. It’s… quieter. Like lavender from a garden, not a candle shop. Maybe a bit… herby? Earthy? I don’t know. It just smells clean. And calm. Honestly, that **lavender tallow balm** smell is the main reason I kept using it at the start. Because putting beef fat on your face feels medieval. But the smell makes it feel like a thing you’re doing for yourself, not a punishment.\n\nThe texture is weird. In a good way. You scoop a tiny bit—a little goes a long way—and it melts the second it hits your skin. Like, it’s solid in the jar, but your skin warmth just turns it to oil. But not a greasy oil. It’s a dry oil? Is that a thing? It just… sinks in. After a minute, you can’t feel it. Your skin just feels like skin. But better skin. My face didn’t feel like it was wearing a mask. It just felt… normal. Hydrated. Not screaming at me.\n\n## Conas a Úsáidim É (How I Use It)\n\nMy routine is chaos. I have no routine. But this balm found a spot. It’s my last thing at night. After I wash my face, or sometimes if I’m lazy and just splash water. I’ll sit on the edge of my bed, open the jar, and that smell just… hits. It’s the signal that the day is done. Phone down. Thoughts off. It’s a two-second ritual.\n\nI rub a bit between my fingers to warm it, then pat it on. Cheeks, forehead, neck. Sometimes my elbows if they’re like sandpaper. I’ve used it on my lips when they’re chapped—works better than any lip balm I’ve bought, which is ridiculous when you think about it. It’s just beef fat and lavender.\n\nI don’t use it in the morning. My skin doesn’t need it then. But at night? It’s become the thing. The **scented tallow balm** is my brain’s off-switch. The smell is so linked with going to sleep now that sometimes I’ll smell it and yawn. It’s Pavlovian. Beef fat and sleep. Who knew?\n\nHere’s a useless detail: the jar lives on my bedside table next to a book I haven’t finished and a hair tie. The lid gets a bit dusty. It feels like a real thing in my life, not a product I’m “testing.”\n\n## An Toradh? (The Result?)\n\nI didn’t notice a change for a few days. And then I did. It wasn’t dramatic. My skin didn’t become “glass.” It just… stopped being a problem. The flakiness around my nose and eyebrows? Gone. The tight, itchy feeling I’d get an hour after washing my face? Gone. The random dry patches on my cheeks that makeup would cling to? History.\n\nIt just balanced out. It looks calm. It feels calm. When I wake up, my skin feels soft. Not “product” soft. Just… healthy soft. Like it sorted itself out overnight. I used to have this red, sensitive patch on one cheek—maybe a mild bit of psoriasis, maybe just irritation—and it’s just faded away. I wasn’t even using the balm to target it. It just happened.\n\nI sound like an ad. I’m not. I’m just surprised. And a bit annoyed that the simplest, weirdest thing is what worked. All those complex serums with unpronounceable ingredients did nothing. This jar of whipped cow fat and flowers fixed it. My wallet is confused but grateful.\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop that just does tallow stuff. The owner was nice, answered my weird questions before I ordered. It feels good to buy from a person, not a factory.\n\n## Ceisteanna a Fhaighim Go Minic (Quick Questions I Get Asked)\n\n**An bhfuil tallow maith do d’aghaidh? (Is beef tallow good for your face?)**\nYeah, weirdly. The science-y reason, from what I read, is that it’s similar to the oils our own skin makes. So it absorbs properly instead of sitting on top and clogging things. It’s like giving your skin something it actually recognizes. Makes sense when you think about it. Old-school sense.\n\n**An dtógann sé pores? (Does tallow balm clog pores?)**\nNot for me, and I have skin that clogs if you look at it funny. It’s non-comedogenic, they say. Because it’s so similar to our sebum, it just gets absorbed. It doesn’t feel heavy or pore-clogging at all. It’s the opposite of that gross, slick feeling.\n\n**Cad a bhfuil boladh ar an mbalm lavender? (What does the lavender tallow balm smell like?)**\nGod, I’m bad at this. It’s not sweet. It’s a dry, herby, green kind of lavender. Like the plant itself, crushed between your fingers. It’s calming. Not overpowering. You smell it when you open the jar, but it doesn’t linger on your skin all night. It’s just there for the experience.\n\nSo yeah. That’s it. I’m probably going to order another jar soon. I look forward to using it, which is a sentence I never thought I’d say about beef fat. If your skin is being difficult, or you just want a nice, simple thing to do at night, this **lavender tallow balm** might be worth a shot. It’s just… nice. It works. I don’t know what else to say.\n\nAnyway. My foot is still asleep. Time for bed.",
