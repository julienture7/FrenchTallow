  "title": "So I Put Beef Fat on My Face: The Pear Tallow Balm That Actually Works",
  "body": "Okay look. It’s January. My skin feels like old paper. The air is just… mean. I was in the bathroom, staring at my hands, and they looked like a map of a desert. All cracked. I’d tried the lotion from the drugstore, the fancy stuff my sister gave me, everything. Nothing stuck. It was like pouring water on a rock.\n\nThen I remembered this jar. I’d ordered it on a weird, late-night internet dive. Beef tallow balm. Sounds gross, right? Like, cooking fat. For your skin. I was skeptical. So skeptical. But it was sitting there, this little glass jar from some Etsy shop in France. The label said “Whipped Tallow Balm - Pear.” I figured, what’s the worst that could happen.\n\nI unscrewed the lid. And here’s the thing—it didn’t smell like beef. At all. It smelled… good. Really good. Not like a candle or perfume. Just clean. Fresh. Like you cut up a pear and left it on a wooden counter in a sunny room. Or maybe not. I’m bad at this. It’s just a nice smell. A pear tallow balm smell, I guess. Simple. Not trying too hard.\n\nAnyway. I scooped a little. The texture was weird. In a good way. Not greasy. Not like lotion. It was thick but soft, like if cold butter and whipped cream had a baby. It melted the second it touched my skin. My hands just… drank it. No film. No sticky feeling. Just gone. And my skin felt different. Not slippery. Just normal, but better. Hydrated. Like it remembered what it was supposed to feel like.\n\nI just stood there for a second. Huh.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Stopped Sounding Insane\n\nSo I had to look this up. Because putting beef fat on my face felt like a prank I was playing on myself. Turns out, tallow is basically the fat from around a cow’s kidneys. Grass-fed beef suet, specifically. They whip it until it’s this fluffy, luxurious texture. And the reason it’s not totally bonkers? It’s supposed to be super close to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So your skin recognizes it. It absorbs deep, doesn’t just sit on top clogging stuff up.\n\nIt mimics human skin sebum. That’s the phrase. I read that and was like, okay, that makes a weird kind of sense. It’s not an alien chemical. It’s just… fat. Good fat. Made in France, apparently. Fancy beef fat.\n\nMy brain went: expensive French skincare in a fancy bottle = $200. French beef fat in a mason jar = way less. And it might actually work? I was intrigued. The pear scent just made the whole idea less… medieval. It made it feel like a normal skincare thing, not a survivalist hack.\n\n## What This Pear Scent Tallow Balm Actually Does (For Me)\n\nMy routine is not a routine. It’s chaos. Sometimes I wash my face with water. Sometimes I remember I have a face. Winter makes me remember, because my face starts to hurt.\n\nThis jar lives on my nightstand now. Next to my water glass and a pile of receipts. The pear scent is the reason I use it. Honestly. If it smelled like nothing, or worse, like beef, I’d forget. But that light, fresh, fruity smell? It’s a little moment. At night, after I finally turn off my phone, I scoop a bit. Rub it between my palms. It smells gentle. Sophisticated? Maybe. It just smells clean and a little sweet.\n\nI warm it up and press it into my face. My cheeks, my forehead. Around my eyes—they get these little dry lines. I put it on my lips. My elbows, which are a disaster zone. My knuckles, the worst offenders.\n\nIt’s not magic. But it’s the closest thing I’ve found. The tallow balm sinks in. My skin doesn’t feel tight in the morning. It feels… quiet. My lips aren’t cracked. This is huge. I used to have this tube of medicated lip stuff I carried everywhere. Now I don’t.\n\nI use it on my hands after I do dishes. Before bed. Sometimes in the morning if it’s really cold. It’s become the thing I reach for. Because it works, and because the scent of this natural pear skincare thing is just nice. It’s a tiny, pleasant ritual. In a life of buzzing phones and to-do lists, that’s something.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI don’t take selfies. But my mom saw me last weekend and said, “Your skin looks good. Rested.” My mom doesn’t say stuff like that. She says, “You look tired,” or “Is that a new shirt?”\n\nThe cracks on my hands are gone. Actually gone. The skin on my elbows is smoother. Not perfect-smooth, but human-smooth. Not sandpaper. The fine lines around my eyes—I mean, they’re still there, I’m not 22—but they look less… angry. Less dry. Just softer.\n\nThe biggest thing is I don’t think about my skin anymore. It’s not a problem to solve. It’s just my skin. It’s comfortable. It doesn’t itch or feel tight. I didn’t expect that. I expected maybe a little relief. Not this.\n\nI got one for my mom. She called me confused. “It says tallow?” Yeah, mom. Just try it. She texted me two days later: “My knees thank you.” That’s a win.\n\n## Would I Buy This Scented Tallow Balm Again?\n\nI’m on my second jar. I ordered it before the first one was even empty. That’s the real review, right? I didn’t wait to see if I’d run out. I just knew I needed another one waiting.\n\nThere’s this Etsy shop, I forget the name, it’s in my orders… “Pure something.” They make it. The jar is simple. The stuff inside is just… effective. In a world full of 12-step routines and serums that promise the moon, this is one jar that does a lot. It’s my desert island product now. If my house was on fire, I’d grab my cat and this balm. (Kidding. Maybe.)\n\nIt’s not cheap, but it’s not crazy. And you use so little. A tiny scoop does your whole face. My first jar lasted over two months, using it almost every day. Compared to the $50 moisturizer that did nothing? It’s a bargain.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just coat your skin—it seems to help it repair itself. My face has never been happier, and I was the biggest skeptic.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot for me, and I can get clogged pores. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog them. It absorbs deep instead of sitting on top. My skin just drinks it up. No breakouts. Actually, my skin seems calmer.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s hard to describe smells. It’s not like a candy pear. It’s light and fresh. Like the idea of a pear, not the syrup. Just a subtle sweetness. It’s gentle. Makes the whole experience feel clean and nice, not like you’re rubbing cooking fat on yourself.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is feeling rough, or tight, or just… sad from the winter, this might be worth a shot. The whole beef tallow thing sounds wild until you try it. I get it. I was there. But this pear tallow balm? It just works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
