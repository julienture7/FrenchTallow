  "title": "My Honest Take on Pear Tallow Balm",
  "body": "My phone was at like 12% and I was just sitting there, staring at this little jar I’d ordered on a whim. Beef fat. For my face. It sounded like something my great-grandma would have used, not something you’d buy off the internet in 2024. But my skin was doing that winter thing where it felt tight and angry no matter what I put on it, and I’d spent, I don’t know, maybe eighty bucks at Target on lotions that just sat on top of my skin and did nothing. So I figured, why not. This whipped tallow balm, the pear-scented one, showed up in a little brown box. I opened it thinking it would smell like a butcher shop. It didn’t. It smelled like… pear? But not like candy. Just a soft, clean fruit smell. Nothing crazy. I poked it. The texture was weird. Good weird. Like cool butter but fluffier.\n\nAnyway, that’s how I started putting beef tallow on my face.\n\n## How I Ended Up With Beef Fat on My Face\n\nLook, my skincare routine before this was a mess. It was a graveyard of half-used bottles on the bathroom counter. There was that green tea serum from the fancy store that cost forty dollars and made me break out. The “intensely moisturizing” night cream in the blue jar that felt like glue. The drugstore lotion that worked for a week and then just… stopped. My hands were the worst. I wash them a lot at work, and by January they’d get these little cracks along the knuckles. They hurt. I’d slather on that thick, perfumed stuff in the big pump bottle, the one that always leaves a film on your phone screen. It helped for five minutes. Then back to sandpaper.\n\nI saw someone talk about tallow balm online. Probably on one of those deep-in-the-comments threads. Someone said it was the only thing that healed their kid’s eczema. I was skeptical. Very. Putting animal fat on your skin seemed like a step backwards, or like a weird homesteader trend. But the logic stuck in my head: it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes. Our sebum. So it might actually absorb instead of just sitting there. Mimics human skin stuff, you know? The one I found was from some small shop on Etsy, made in France from grass-fed cows, all whipped up. The “Pear” scent sounded the least intimidating. I think it was twenty-eight bucks? Free shipping. I clicked buy so fast, mostly out of curiosity. And a little desperation.\n\nIt arrived on a Tuesday. A really cold Tuesday. The heating in my apartment was making that clicking noise it always does.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nSo the first night, I washed my face with my regular stuff. I was looking at the jar. It’s not big. Cute, though. I scooped a tiny bit out with my finger—it’s firm but softens real quick from your body heat. I rubbed it between my palms. It melted. Like, instantly. Into this silky oil. Not greasy. I just patted it all over my face. It felt… different. Not heavy. My skin drank it up. Fast. No shiny residue, just my skin but calmer. I put some on the back of my hands, right on those cracked spots.\n\nThe smell is hard to pin down. It’s there, but it’s not shouting. It’s a subtle sweetness. Gentle. If a fresh pear and clean linen had a baby, that’s it. Sophisticated? I guess. It’s just light. Fruity but in a quiet way. It doesn’t clash with perfume or anything. It’s just nice.\n\nI didn’t expect a miracle. I went to bed.\n\nThe real test was the next morning. Usually, I wake up and my cheeks feel tight, especially in winter. That dry-heat apartment air. But that morning… they didn’t. They just felt normal. Hydrated. Not “moisturized” in a product-y way, just… fine. My hands looked less red. The cracks were still there but they seemed less angry. That was the first “huh” moment.\n\nI started using it every night. Just that one thing. Part of my natural skincare routine, I guess, though I hate that phrase. It sounds so deliberate. For me, it was just the tallow balm. Daily use became automatic. After showering, before bed. Sometimes in the morning if it was really brutal out. I’d use it on my elbows, which are always rough. On my lips, which were perpetually chapped from the wind.\n\nThe weirdest part was what *didn’t* happen. No new breakouts. No clogged pores. My skin just seemed to balance out. It was like it finally got what it needed and stopped freaking out. I wasn’t adding five different serums anymore. Just this one balm. Switching to natural products wasn’t some big ethical stance for me—it was an accident. This one just worked.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of Tallow\n\nOkay so the dramatic transformation stuff is overrated. I didn’t look ten years younger. My pores didn’t vanish. That’s not real life.\n\nBut the real results? Those were quiet. The kind you notice in small moments. Like when I’d go to put on foundation and realize I didn’t need as much because my skin wasn’t flaky underneath. Or when I’d wash my hands at work and they wouldn’t immediately scream for lotion. The cracks on my knuckles actually healed. They’re just… normal knuckles now. My elbows are smoother. Not baby-smooth, but like, human-being smooth. The fine lines around my eyes—the ones that get more noticeable when I’m dehydrated—they just look less… deep? I don’t know how else to say it.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s maintenance. But good maintenance. The kind where you’re not constantly fighting your own skin.\n\nI remember one night, maybe three weeks in, I was watching TV and absentmindedly touched my cheek. And I just thought, “Oh. It’s soft.” Not product-soft. Healthy soft. It was such a simple thing. I’d spent so much time and money trying to get to that feeling with complicated routines, and this one jar of whipped beef fat did it. I laughed at myself. My cat looked at me like I was crazy.\n\nI told my mom about it. She was horrified at first. “You put what on your face?” But then she tried it on her dry heels. She called me two days later asking for the Etsy shop link. That’s the real testimonial, right there.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nI’m on my second jar now. The first one lasted me a good two months, using it pretty much every day on my face and spots on my body. I got it from that same little Etsy shop—I just searched for “whipped tallow balm pear” again. It’s become my non-negotiable. When I travel, I take a little scoop of it in a contact lens case. It’s that essential.\n\nIt’s winter again as I’m writing this. The air is dry. My heater is clicking. And my skin is… fine. Honestly, fine is the best possible outcome. It’s not a crisis. It’s just skin, living its life, supported by this very simple, very old-school balm. I don’t have a twelve-step routine anymore. I have this one jar. And for the first time in a long time, that feels like enough.\n\nAnyway, if your skin is feeling tight or rough or just generally pissed off at the weather, a tallow balm might be worth a shot. It sounds weird. It is a little weird. But it just works. I don’t know what else to say.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. The science-y reason is that it’s really similar to the natural oils (sebum) our skin produces. So it absorbs deeply instead of sitting on top. It’s packed with vitamins and fats that help nourish and repair the skin barrier. My face seems to recognize it as something useful, not an invader.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nIt hasn’t for me, and I can be prone to clogged pores. Because it’s so similar to our own skin oils, it absorbs cleanly. It’s not a heavy, pore-clogging wax or mineral oil. It just melts in. If you’re super oily, you might use less, but for my combo/dry skin, it’s been perfect.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light and fresh. Not like pear candy. More like the gentle, clean scent of a real pear with maybe a tiny bit of something floral or linen-like underneath. It’s subtle. It doesn’t stick around all day, it’s just a nice little scent when you apply it. It’s not overpowering at all.\n\nSo yeah. If you're curious, the Pear Whipped Tallow Balm from that Etsy shop is the one that worked for me. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
