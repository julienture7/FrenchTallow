  "title": "Lavender Tallow Balm: The Weird Thing That Fixed My Winter Face",
  "body": "Okay so my face was just… done. It was like, last Tuesday maybe? No, Wednesday. Because trash day. Anyway. I was looking in the bathroom mirror after washing my hands and my skin looked like one of those old maps. All cracked. Red lines everywhere. I’d tried the Cetaphil stuff in the big tub. The La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+M that everyone swears by. Even slathered on straight Vaseline before bed like some kind of greasy ghost. Nothing. My cheeks felt tight all the time. My forehead was flaky. It was a whole situation.\n\nAnd it was cold. The kind of cold that makes the air in your apartment feel thin. My heater was making that clicking noise it does. So I was scrolling on my phone, half-watching some cooking show, and my face hurt. Actually hurt. I got an ad for this beef tallow balm. Tallow. Like, from a cow. For your face. I remember thinking, you have got to be kidding me. But the ad said it was whipped tallow balm. Lavender scent. For dry skin. I was desperate enough to click.\n\n## How I Ended Up Putting Beef Fat on My Face\n\nLook. I’m not a crunchy person. I buy the regular toothpaste. But I was out of ideas. This tallow skincare thing kept popping up. People saying it was this ancient moisturizer. Made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up. From France, apparently. The logic was it mimics human skin sebum so it sinks in deep instead of sitting on top. Sounded like a stretch. But also, my fancy $68 cream from Sephora was doing exactly nothing. So what did I have to lose except maybe smelling like a barn.\n\nI found this little Etsy shop. The pictures were simple. No crazy claims. Just a jar of balm. I ordered the lavender one because the description said calming. And I needed calm. My skin was giving me anxiety. I paid and forgot about it for a week. Then this small package arrived. Brown paper. Stamped. Felt very… earnest.\n\nThe jar itself was heavy. Glass. I unscrewed the lid. First thought: it doesn’t smell like beef. Thank god. It smelled like… lavender? But not the candle aisle lavender. More like the actual plant. Herbal. A little earthy. Not sweet. It was a quiet smell. The texture threw me. It was solid in the jar but when I scooped a bit with my finger, it melted. Just… turned into oil. Weird. Not bad weird. I rubbed it between my palms to warm it up and patted it on my face. It felt… slick. But five minutes later? Gone. No greasy film. No shine. My skin just felt… quiet. Not tight. I went to bed skeptical but comfortable.\n\n## What This Lavender Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nHere’s the thing. I didn’t expect magic. I just wanted my face to stop hurting. The first week I used it every night. After washing my face with just water—the CeraVe hydrating cleanser was too much sometimes—I’d warm a tiny dab in my hands. The smell was the best part of my day. Not like a perfume. It was like that timeless herbal smell from a real garden. It made my whole bedtime routine feel intentional. Like a ritual. I’d put it on and read for a bit. I slept better. I can’t prove the lavender did that but I’m not arguing.\n\nThe actual results on my dry skin were slow. Then suddenly they weren’t. After maybe ten days, I was putting on makeup for a Zoom thing and I realized my foundation wasn’t catching on flakes. It just went on smooth. My skin looked… even. Not “glowing” in that weird influencer way. Just healthy. Like it had enough water. The red, cracked map lines on my cheeks were just gone. The skin around my nose, which always gets wrecked in winter, was normal. Just normal skin! I hadn’t seen normal skin on my own face since maybe October.\n\nI started using it on my hands too. Because why not. I wash my hands constantly. They’re always dry and cracked at the knuckles. I’d use the tiniest bit after doing dishes. Same thing. The cracks healed. My cuticles stopped peeling. It’s this deeply nourishing thing but it doesn’t feel heavy. It’s not a lotion. It’s more like your skin is eating it. I told my sister about it and she was horrified. “You put what on your face?” But then she saw my hands. She asked to try it. Now she has her own jar.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of Tallow\n\nI’m probably a month in now. My skin barrier isn’t just repaired, it’s… chill. I don’t have to think about it. That’s the real win. I used to plan my day around my skin’s bad moods. Now I just wash my face and put this tallow balm on. Morning and night. In the morning I use a rice-grain amount. At night, a bit more. It’s my whole routine. I read that tallow is good for fine lines and winter damage. Even stuff like psoriasis. I don’t have that, but I get it. This stuff feels like armor.\n\nA random tangent: it made me think about my grandma. She used lard on her hands in the winter. She’d keep a little tin by the sink. I thought it was gross. Now I’m like… oh. She knew. It’s the same idea. Using a pure, simple fat to protect and heal. Sometimes the old ways are the old ways for a reason. Anyway.\n\nComparing it to other stuff is almost funny. That La Roche-Posay balm felt like it sat on top of my skin forever. This tallow balm? It’s in there. Working. It doesn’t clog my pores—I was worried about that—because it’s so similar to our own skin oils. My face just drinks it. For a natural skincare option, it’s weirdly effective. More than any plant oil I’ve tried. I’m on my second jar now. I keep the first one, almost empty, in my bag.\n\n## Would I Buy This Lavender Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. Obviously. I already did.\n\nIt’s not a miracle. It’s a tool. A really, really good tool. For the specific problem of dry, angry, winter-wrecked skin, it’s the best thing I’ve found. It’s simple. Jar, balm, done. The lavender scent is perfect. Truly calming. Not fake. It makes using it a pleasure. I’ve even started putting a tiny bit on my temples if I have a headache. The smell helps.\n\nIf you’re curious about tallow skincare, I’d say start here. With a whipped balm from a good source. This one from that Etsy shop is made in France from grass-fed cows. It matters. You don’t want just any fat. You want the good stuff. It’s not cheap, but the jar lasts forever. I’ve had mine for over a month and I’m maybe halfway? And I use it on my face and hands daily.\n\nSo that’s my story. From skeptical to… a believer, I guess. My skin is happy. I’m happy. I don’t have to think about it anymore. In the middle of winter, that’s a bigger win than it sounds like.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nSounds crazy, right? But yeah. It is. Our skin produces sebum, which is a type of fat. Beef tallow is structurally really similar. So your skin recognizes it and absorbs it deeply instead of just letting it sit on the surface. It’s like giving your skin the building blocks it already knows how to use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this too. But no, not for me. Because it’s so similar to our own skin oils, it absorbs cleanly. It doesn’t just sit there and gunk things up. If anything, my pores look smaller because my skin isn’t freaking out and over-producing oil to compensate for being dry.\n\n**What does the lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nNot like a candle. Or soap. It’s a real, herbal lavender smell. Earthy. A little green. It’s calming in a real way, not a fake “relaxing” scent way. It just smells clean and natural. The smell doesn’t linger all day, but it’s lovely while you’re putting it on.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, especially in this dry winter air, it might be worth a shot. I didn’t think I’d be a person who evangelizes about beef fat, but here I am. It just works.",
