  "title": "My Weird Winter Skin and That Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm",
  "body": "Look. My face was a disaster zone. It was like, mid-January, and the air felt like it was actively trying to suck the life out of my skin. You know that feeling? Tight. Flaky in weird patches. The space between my eyebrows was a cracked desert. I’d wake up and it felt like I was wearing a mask made of old paper. I was using that fancy La Mer cream my sister gave me for my birthday—the one that costs more than my car payment—and it did nothing. Just sat there. Felt greasy. Made my pillowcase gross. I tried the CeraVe stuff everyone talks about. The Cetaphil in the big tub. Even slathered on straight Vaseline like some kind of deranged slug. Nothing. My skin was still thirsty. And angry. And very, very beige.\n\nAnyway. I was scrolling on my phone one night, it was like 11:47pm, and my thumb was just hitting “refresh” on the same three apps. Saw something about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. My first thought was, obviously, “what.” Like, are we pioneers? Is this a joke? But the algorithm had me. It kept showing me these little Etsy shops. One of them was this French one. Their thing was this Whipped Tallow Balm in Bourbon Vanilla. The pictures looked… normal. Not weird. Cozy, even. I was skeptical. So skeptical. But I was also desperate. And my credit card was right there. So I clicked it. Figured if it was terrible, I’d just hide it in the back of a drawer and never speak of it again.\n\n## How Beef Tallow Ended Up on My Face\n\nI need to back up. Why did I even consider smearing cow fat on myself? I guess because everything else was a bust. I’d spent so much money on bottles with fancy French words. Things that promised to “replenish your lipid barrier” or whatever. They all felt like they were building a wall on top of my skin, not getting into it. Then I read, just in some random comment section, that tallow is weirdly similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So it’s like… your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit there pretending to be helpful. It actually gets absorbed. That made a stupid kind of sense to me. Like, we put oil from nuts and plants on our face all the time. Why is a purified, grass-fed animal fat any weirder? I don’t know. It just clicked in my brain in a way that “hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid complex” never did.\n\nThe jar showed up maybe two weeks later. It was smaller than I thought. Cute little glass jar. I opened it. Okay, scent time. This is where I braced for “farmyard” or “sad candle.” But it wasn’t that. It smelled like… vanilla. But not the sickly sweet birthday cake kind. Warmer. Deeper. Like if you baked vanilla beans into something and then left it to cool on a windowsill. Comforting. Not a perfume smell. Just a smell. I poked it. The texture threw me. It was whipped, like they said, but it was firm. Kind of waxy? I scooped a tiny bit and rubbed it between my fingers. It melted immediately. Just turned into this silky oil. Weird. Not bad weird.\n\nI put a little on the back of my hand first. I’m not an idiot. It soaked in. Like, really soaked in. Didn’t leave my hand shiny. Just soft. So that night, after I washed my face, I went for it. Took a pea-sized amount, warmed it up, and just patted it all over my dry, sad face. It felt… heavy for a second. Then it was gone. My skin didn’t feel greasy. It felt quiet. For the first time in months, it didn’t feel tight. I just went to bed.\n\n## What Actually Happened to My Skin\n\nI didn’t expect a miracle overnight. But the next morning, my face wasn’t a flakey mess. It was just… calm. The red, irritated patches around my nose were less angry. I used it again. And again. I started using it on my knuckles, which get these deep cracks in winter that hurt when you make a fist. I used it on my elbows, which are permanently rough like shark skin. It just… worked. It’s not a dramatic transformation. It’s not like I look airbrushed. It’s subtler than that. My skin just stopped freaking out. It feels like my skin again. Not like skin that’s at war with the weather.\n\nHere’s a random thing. I was putting it on one night and it reminded me of this super expensive lip balm I bought at an airport once. The one in the little metal tin that you have to dig your finger into. That same kind of waxy-but-melts feeling. But this was for my whole face. And it cost way less. That’s when I knew I was hooked. I started using it on my cuticles. On a dry patch on my ankle. It became the one jar I reached for when anything felt rough or tight.\n\nI’m on my second jar now. I keep the first one in my bathroom and I actually just ordered another one to keep in my bag. I told my mom about it. She was even more skeptical than me. “Beef tallow? From France?” But she tried it. Now she texts me about it. “My hands don’t look like lizard skin anymore.” High praise.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. Obviously. I already did.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s not going to make you look 25 again. But if your skin is dry, or sensitive, or just pissed off at the world, it’s like giving it a glass of water. A really good, nourishing glass of water that it actually knows how to drink. I don’t know how else to explain it. All those other creams felt like they were talking *at* my skin. This one just… works with it.\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it in France. The whole process seems clean. Grass-fed cows, whipped by hand, all that. It feels like someone made it in their kitchen, but a very clean, professional French kitchen. Not a corporate lab. That matters to me, I guess. I like knowing what’s in it. Suet, some olive oil, some vanilla. That’s basically it.\n\nSo if you’re out there with a bottle of something expensive that’s not working, staring at your flaky reflection… maybe just try it. The beef tallow thing sounds bizarre. I know. But sometimes the bizarre thing is the simple thing. And the simple thing works.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to the oils our own skin produces, it absorbs way better than a lot of plant oils or synthetic stuff. It doesn’t just sit on top. It’s like giving your skin back what the dry winter air steals.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores pretty easy. Since it absorbs so deeply, it doesn’t just block everything up. It’s non-comedogenic, which is a fancy word for “won’t clog your pores.” My skin actually feels clearer since using it, because it’s not freaking out and over-producing oil to compensate for being so dry.\n\n**What does Bourbon Vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like real vanilla. Not fake ice cream vanilla. Warmer. Like vanilla extract you’d bake with, mixed with something just a tiny bit deeper—that’s the “bourbon” part, I guess. It’s not strong. It doesn’t linger. It’s just a nice, cozy smell when you open the jar. Fades pretty fast after you put it on.\n\nAnyway. That’s my tallow story. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. I’m probably gonna order a third jar soon just to have it around. You know, just in case.",
