  "title": "Pear Tallow Balm: Yeah, I Put Beef Fat On My Face. Here's Why.",
  "body": "Okay so. I bought beef fat for my face. I know how that sounds. Just wait.\n\nIt’s winter. My skin was doing that thing. You know the thing. Tight. Flaky. Like if you smiled too hard it might crack. I was using this expensive lotion from the mall, the one in the blue bottle that smells like a perfume store exploded. It did nothing. My hands looked like a dried-up riverbed. It was bad.\n\nI was scrolling on my phone, probably avoiding work, and I saw this stuff. Whipped tallow balm. Pear scent. Made in France. My first thought was, obviously, “What? No.” My second thought was, “...But what if?” I think it was a Tuesday. Maybe Wednesday. The afternoon was gray. I just clicked buy. A weird little experiment.\n\nIt showed up a while later. Small jar. Fancy label. I opened it. Smelled like... pear? But not candy pear. More like a real pear that’s almost ripe, sitting in a cool kitchen. Gentle. Not overpowering. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter but softer. I poked it. I was skeptical. Very skeptical. Putting beef tallow on my face felt like a step too far, even for me.\n\n## How I Ended Up Smearing Beef Fat on My Cheeks\n\nSo I had to look this up. Because I’m not just gonna slap cow fat on my face without some kind of reason, you know? My brain needed permission.\n\nTurns out, it’s not that new. It’s actually really, really old. Like, grandma’s-grandma old. People used animal fats for skin forever. Lard, bear grease, all that. This is just grass-fed beef tallow, which is the fat from around the kidneys. They clean it, render it, whip it up. The science-y part that got me is this: our skin’s natural oil, sebum? It has a bunch of fatty acids in it. Tallow’s fatty acid profile is super similar. So your skin kinda goes, “Oh, hey, I know this stuff.” It recognizes it. It absorbs it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a weird silicone mask.\n\nIt’s not like putting cooking grease on your face. This is purified, whipped, blended with a few other natural ingredients. It made a weird kind of sense. Like using honey on a cut. Old wisdom. Sometimes the old ways stick around because they just… work. I was still grossed out, but now I was intellectually grossed out. Which is better, I guess.\n\nAnyway, my knuckles were cracking. I was desperate. So I went for it.\n\n## What Happened When I Actually Used the Stuff\n\nCold at first. You scoop a tiny bit. Rub it between your fingers to warm it up. Then it just… melts. It goes from this waxy balm to almost nothing. You pat it on. On my dry winter hands first. It sank in. Like, really sank in. No greasy film. No shiny residue. My hands just felt… quiet. Not thirsty anymore. That was the first sign.\n\nMy face was next. I was nervous. I have skin that can get weird about products. I used a tiny, tiny amount. Pressed it into my cheeks, my forehead. It felt… fine? Not heavy. Not sticky. I went to bed expecting to wake up with a face full of zits or something.\n\nI didn’t. My skin just felt calm in the morning. Not oily. Not dry. Just calm. That was new.\n\nThe real test was a few days later. Windy day, below freezing. I walked the dog. Came back inside, my face usually feels like it’s screaming. That tight, burning feeling. I put a little of this tallow balm on after. The screaming stopped. It just… stopped. I sat there on my couch, with my dumb dog, and thought, “Huh.” It was a genuine “huh” moment. I didn’t expect it to do anything. And it did the thing.\n\nI started using it on my lips too. Chapped lips are a constant winter battle. This fixed them in like, two days. It’s now my go-to. I keep the jar by my bed.\n\n## My Skin Now & The Weird Part That Convinced Me\n\nI’m not gonna say it’s magic. It’s beef fat. But I will say my skin barrier feels less like a crumbling wall and more like an actual barrier. The flakiness is gone. The tightness is gone. When I put on my regular moisturizer now, it actually works better. The tallow balm seems to have fixed the foundation, you know?\n\nHere’s the weird part that sold me. I have this one dry patch on my elbow. Always had it. Since I was a kid. I’ve put every lotion on it. Nothing. It was just a rough, sad little patch of skin. I put this tallow balm on it for a week, just at night. Just to see.\n\nIt’s gone. It’s just… normal skin now. I keep touching it because I can’t believe it. That’s what did it. That stupid elbow.\n\nIt reminds me of this salve my friend’s grandma used to make. She never told us what was in it. It came in a rusty tin and smelled like herbs and dirt. It fixed everything. Cuts, scrapes, dry skin. I think it was probably tallow-based. Grandma wisdom. We overcomplicate everything now.\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it. The Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear. It’s simple. The ingredients list is short. Grass-fed beef tallow, some oils, pear fragrance. That’s it. No twenty-syllable chemicals. In a world of a million skincare steps, it’s weirdly refreshing to use one thing that does a lot.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nMy first jar is almost gone. I ordered another one last week. I got one for my mom too, for her hands. She called me and was like, “What is this? It’s wonderful.” I didn’t tell her what it was until after she liked it. Classic.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. If you’re vegan, obviously not. If the idea skeeves you out, you’ll never get past it. And that’s fine. But if your skin is feeling angry with winter, or with life, and nothing in a plastic bottle is helping… this might be worth a shot. It’s a back-to-basics thing. Sometimes the simplest solution is the oldest one.\n\nI don’t use it as my only moisturizer. I use it as my last step, at night, or on really dry spots during the day. A little goes a long way. The pear scent is nice. Light. Doesn’t smell like a barnyard, I promise. It just smells clean and a little fruity.\n\nAnyway. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. Because it’s so similar to the oils our skin makes naturally, it absorbs deep and helps repair the skin barrier. It’s not like putting bacon grease on your cheek. It’s purified and whipped into a balm. My face likes it way more than a lot of fancy creams.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nIt hasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores. Because it’s so similar to sebum, my skin seems to know what to do with it. It sinks in instead of sitting on top. Everyone’s different, but it’s generally considered non-comedogenic.\n\n**What does the Pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s not a strong candy smell. It’s like a fresh, ripe pear. Light. A little sweet, but clean. It doesn’t stick around all day, which I like. It’s just a nice scent when you’re putting it on.\n\nSo yeah. If you’re curious about this whole tallow skincare thing, the pear balm is a good place to start. It just works. I don’t know what else to say.",
