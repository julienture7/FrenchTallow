  "title": "That Pineapple Tallow Balm: What Actually Happened to My Winter Skin",
  "body": "Look, my face was a disaster. It was January, the air was basically sandpaper, and my skin had decided to just give up. Flaky patches on my cheeks, this tight feeling all the time, and my forehead looked like a cracked riverbed. I was using that fancy La Mer cream my sister gave me for Christmas—the one that costs more than my car payment—and it was doing absolutely nothing. Nothing. I was slathering it on twice a day and still waking up feeling like a lizard. I was desperate. I was googling “dry skin” fixes at 2 AM, which is how you end up in weird corners of the internet. That’s where I first saw people talking about beef tallow skincare. Tallow balm. Like, beef fat. For your face. I closed the tab. No way.\n\nBut then I saw it again on some random forum, someone swearing by this whipped tallow balm from some little shop. The scent was pineapple. Pineapple. It sounded so bizarre I couldn’t forget it. Beef fat that smells like a tropical vacation? My brain short-circuited. I was skeptical, obviously. But my skin was so bad I was willing to try anything that wasn’t another $200 jar of disappointment. So I ordered it. The Whipped Tallow Balm in Pineapple, from this Etsy shop based in France. I figured if it was gross, I’d just be out thirty bucks and have a funny story.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Even Became a Thing I Tried\n\nOkay so the jar showed up. It’s winter, right? My porch was freezing. The box was cold. I brought it inside and just stared at it for a day. A jar of whipped beef fat. From France. Smelling like pineapple. The whole concept was just… a lot.\n\nI finally opened it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It’s like this super thick, dense cream? But it’s whipped so it’s also kind of airy. You scoop a tiny bit and it feels solid, then it melts the second it hits your skin. It’s not like any lotion I’ve used. It’s made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up. The idea is it mimics human skin sebum, so it gets absorbed deep instead of just sitting on top. I read that while I was waiting for it to arrive, half-convinced I was being pranked.\n\nThe smell. God, the smell. It’s not a fake, candy pineapple. It’s like… a real pineapple got sunburned on a beach somewhere. It’s sweet but not sickly. Cheerful. It smells like summer in a jar, which is the most confusing thing when you’re looking at a snowstorm out your window and holding beef fat. I told my sister about it and she just said “you’re putting what on your face?” and hung up. So there’s that.\n\nAnyway, I was skeptical but my CeraVe moisturizer from the Walgreens on 5th—not the one by the highway, that one’s always out of stock—wasn’t cutting it. Neither was the La Mer. Or that Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream everyone loves. My skin drank that stuff and asked for more, still thirsty. So one night, after my shower, I took a tiny dab of the tallow balm. Rubbed it between my fingers to warm it up. Braced myself.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt melted. Immediately. Like it just vanished into my skin. No greasy film. No shiny residue. My face just… ate it. And it felt calm. For the first time in weeks, that tight, itchy, screaming feeling just stopped. It was so quiet. I just stood there in my bathroom, in my sweatpants, baffled.\n\nI started using it every night. A little goes a seriously long way. I’d wake up and my skin wasn’t flaking on my pillowcase. The rough patches on my cheeks started to smooth out. Not overnight, but within a few days I could see a difference. After a week, the cracks were healing. My skin just looked… healthier. Not “glowing” in that weird Instagram way, but like it was actually hydrated from the inside. Like it had what it needed.\n\nHere’s the weird part. I started using it on my hands too. Winter destroys my hands. They crack at the knuckles and it hurts to make a fist. I put the tallow balm on them before bed with some cheap cotton gloves. Woke up and my hands were soft. Not “baby soft” or whatever, just normal. Not cracked. Not hurting. I didn’t have to reapply lotion six times a day. That alone was a game-changer.\n\nI got a random tangent for you. This whole thing reminded me of my grandpa. He used to use bag balm, that green tin for cows, on his cracked hands after working outside. I thought that was the grossest thing when I was a kid. Now I’m sitting here putting beef tallow on my face and I finally get it. Sometimes the simple, kinda weird stuff just works. Modern skincare feels like a chemistry experiment. This feels like… just giving your skin what it’s missing.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been like, a month and a half maybe. I’m still using it. I’m on my second jar now, actually. I use it as my night cream. Sometimes in the morning if it’s really brutal out. My winter dry skin situation is basically gone. My face doesn’t feel tight. No flakes. Even the psoriasis patch I sometimes get on my elbow has chilled out a lot since I started putting the balm on it.\n\nIt’s not magic. It doesn’t make you look 20 again. But it fixed the problem I actually had, which was my skin being painfully, visibly dry and angry. It just works. It’s a simple, natural skincare thing that does one job really well: it moisturizes deeply. It absorbs. It doesn’t clog my pores—I was worried about that—but it seems to just sink in and do its thing. My skin feels balanced. Not oily, not dry. Just okay.\n\nI even use it on my lips now. Chapped lips in winter are the worst. A tiny bit of this balm seals everything in. Tastes vaguely fruity if you get some in your mouth, which is a strange but not unpleasant side effect.\n\nWould I buy it again? Yeah. I already did. I’m probably gonna order another one soon because I don’t want to run out. I gave my first, nearly-empty jar to my mom who has even drier skin than me and she texted me last week asking for the link. That’s the real test, right? If your mom wants it.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. The science-y reason is that it’s really similar to the oils our own skin makes. So it absorbs deep instead of sitting on top like a lot of plant oils or mineral oil can. It’s like giving your skin back what the dry winter air steals from it.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores pretty easy. Because it mimics our own sebum, my skin seems to know what to do with it. It absorbs. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy once it melts in. It just feels like skin.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like a real, ripe pineapple, not candy. Sweet and tropical and just… happy. It’s a strong scent when you open the jar but it fades pretty fast once it’s on your skin. It’s the most confusingly delightful part of the whole experience.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, if the usual stuff isn’t working, this might be worth a shot. I was super skeptical about tallow skincare but now I’m just a person with a jar of pineapple-scented beef fat on my nightstand. And my skin’s happy. So I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
