  "title": "That Pear Tallow Balm I Use Now: What It Actually Does",
  "body": "Okay so I’m sitting here, it’s like 9 PM maybe, and my face feels tight. Like that weird winter tight. The heat’s on and it’s just sucking all the moisture out of the room. My hands look like a lizard’s. Anyway. I just put on this tallow balm stuff I got a few weeks back. The pear one. And I was just thinking about how it’s weirdly become a thing I do now. My tallow balm routine. Sounds fancy but it’s not. It’s just me, on the couch, with a little jar of whipped beef fat. Look, I know how that sounds. But just wait.\n\nIt started because my knuckles were cracking. Like bleeding cracking. I tried that thick cream in the blue tub. Nothing. I tried that expensive French stuff my sister swore by. Felt like wax. So I was scrolling, probably avoiding work, and saw this Etsy shop. Whipped tallow balm. Made in France. Grass-fed beef suet. I was like… beef fat? For my face? That’s a new level of weird. But the reviews were all these normal people saying it fixed their winter skin. And the pear scent sounded… okay. Not like a steak candle. So I got it. It was a Tuesday. I remember because the package came and I had to sign for it and I was in my sweatpants.\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face\n\nSo the jar shows up. Small. Kinda cute. I open it. Texture was… not what I expected. I thought it’d be greasy. Like bacon grease. But it’s whipped. Like if butter and cloud had a baby. Fluffy. I poked it. Cold. I put a tiny bit on my finger. Smelled like… pear? But not candy pear. Like a real pear that’s almost ripe. Just a little sweet. Gentle. Nothing crazy.\n\nFirst night I was scared. I put the tiniest dab on my cheek. Like half a pea. Rubbed it in. It was cold then it just… went away. Didn’t sit on top of my skin. Didn’t feel gross. My skin just drank it. I woke up and that cheek was… calm. Not red. Not tight. Just normal. So the next night I did my whole face. Same thing. A little goes a long way, that’s the first thing about a daily skincare with tallow. You don’t need a glob. I use maybe a pea-sized amount for my whole face and neck. Sometimes less.\n\nMy routine now is stupid simple. I wash my face with that cheap gel cleanser. Pat it dry but leave it a tiny bit damp. Then I scoop a bit of the tallow balm. Warm it between my fingers for like two seconds. Then just press it all over. Forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, neck. I don’t rub hard. Just press and pat. Takes 30 seconds. Then I sit there and my face doesn’t feel like it’s going to crack open. That’s it. That’s the whole how to use tallow balm thing. No ten steps. No waiting for layers to dry. I can do it half-asleep.\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nI got curious after it worked. So I looked it up. This is a tangent but it’s interesting. Beef tallow, especially from grass-fed cows, has a fat profile really close to our own skin’s sebum. Our skin recognizes it. So it absorbs deep instead of sitting on top clogging stuff up. It’s not like putting mineral oil on your face. It’s more like giving your skin back what the winter air and heaters steal. That’s the sciencey part I guess. All I know is my skin stopped freaking out. The tightness just… stopped.\n\nI use it on my hands too. After dishes. My hands used to get so dry they’d itch. Now I keep the jar by the sink. Dry my hands, tiny dab of tallow, rub it in. Takes a minute to sink in but then they’re just… soft. Not greasy. Not slick. Just normal soft. I don’t know how else to describe it. My elbows were always rough. Like sandpaper. I started putting the balm on them at night. Took a week maybe. Now they’re smooth. I’m not kidding. I showed my mom and she was like what did you do. I told her it was beef fat and she made a face. But then she tried it. Now she wants a jar.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt’s not magic. It doesn’t make you look 20 again. But what it does do is make your skin just behave. It’s hydrated. It’s calm. It doesn’t get that angry red reaction when the wind hits it. In winter, that’s everything. The pear scent is light. It doesn’t smell like food. It’s just a fresh, clean, kinda fruity smell that fades fast. It’s not perfume-y. It’s just nice. Sometimes I put it on and my dog sniffs my hand and looks confused. That’s always funny.\n\nI used to have this whole shelf of products. Serums, oils, creams. Trying to fix the dryness. This one little jar replaced like three of them. It’s just… efficient. I use it at night mostly. Sometimes in the morning if my skin feels extra dry. I’ll put a super thin layer on before my sunscreen. Works fine. Doesn’t pill. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that just does tallow stuff. The owner was nice, answered my weird questions fast. Shipping took a bit because it’s from France but it got here.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks\n\nSo it’s been maybe a month now. I’m almost through the jar. I already ordered another one. That’s the real review, right? Repurchasing. My skin just feels balanced. Not oily. Not dry. Just balanced. The little dry patches by my eyebrows are gone. The redness around my nose is way down. My hands don’t crack. It’s just… one less thing to worry about. My skin after was. Just better. I don’t have a better word. It’s not glowing or radiant or any of those words they use in ads. It’s just healthy. Normal. Like it’s supposed to be.\n\nI told my friend about it. She has super sensitive skin. Rosacea. She was terrified to try it. She tried a bit on her wrist for a week. Nothing bad happened. So she tried her face. She texted me last week like “okay wow.” Said it was the first thing that didn’t burn. That’s a big deal.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it gets absorbed really well. It doesn’t just sit there. It’s like deep hydration. Good for winter, good for sensitive skin. Sounds wild but it works.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I can get clogged pores easy. Because it absorbs and mimics sebum, it doesn’t block things up. It’s not like slathering on Vaseline. It’s different. My skin actually feels clearer.\n\n**What does pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light. Like a fresh, ripe pear but not sugary. Just a subtle sweetness. It’s gentle. Fades pretty quick after you put it on. It’s not a strong perfume smell at all.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult with the cold, or just generally pissed off, this might be worth a shot. I was super skeptical. Now I’m just a person with a jar of tallow on the coffee table. It just works. I don’t know what else to say. I’m probably gonna order another one soon.",
