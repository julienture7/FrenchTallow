  "title": "Lavender Tallow Balm: I Put Beef Fat on My Face and It Worked",
  "body": "Okay so I tried this thing. It’s a balm. Made from beef fat. I know, I know. It sounds like something you’d use to season a cast iron pan, not your face. My first thought was literally “absolutely not.” But it’s winter, my skin was doing that tight, itchy, flaky thing it does every February, and the fancy stuff from the mall wasn’t cutting it. I was desperate. So I got this whipped tallow balm, the lavender one, from some small shop on Etsy. Grass-fed beef tallow skincare. There, I said it. It sounded weird. But honestly? It’s not. It’s kind of the opposite of weird. It just… works. I’m sitting here with one sock on because I lost the other one, and my skin hasn’t felt this normal in maybe years.\n\nThe whole idea freaked me out at first. Beef tallow? For your *face*? I pictured grease. I pictured smelling like a kitchen. I pictured clogged pores and breakouts and regret. But then I got curious. And a little bored. And I started poking around online, which is always a dangerous move. Found people talking about it like it was normal. Grandma wisdom stuff. Like, before there was a whole aisle of chemical creams at CVS, people used what they had. Animal fats, plant oils, simple things. Tallow was a big one. For skin, for leather, for cooking. It’s just rendered beef fat. Specifically, the fat from around the kidneys, which is supposed to be the good stuff. When it’s from grass-fed cows, it’s packed with vitamins that are supposedly really similar to what our own skin produces. That was the science-y bit that made me pause. Our skin’s natural oil, sebum, has a certain makeup. Tallow’s makeup is apparently a close match. So the idea is your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a plastic wrap; it actually gets absorbed and says “oh hey, I know this guy.”\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face (A Saga)\n\nI ordered it on a Tuesday night. Or maybe it was Wednesday. It was definitely after 10 PM because I remember the fridge was humming and my cat was judging me from the couch. The listing said it was whipped tallow balm from France, with lavender. Calming. Sleep-promoting. All that. I figured if I was gonna smear beef fat on myself, it should at least smell nice. It arrived in a little jar. No fancy box, just wrapped in paper. I opened it and poked it. The texture was… unexpected. Not greasy. Not hard. It was whipped, like cool butter or really thick frosting. I put a tiny bit on my finger. It melted almost immediately from body heat. I braced myself and rubbed it on the back of my hand.\n\nWait. That’s it? It just… vanished. My skin drank it. No residue. No shiny film. Just soft skin. Huh.\n\nSo I got bold. After a shower that night, I used it on my face. A tiny scoop, warmed between my fingers. It went on smooth. The lavender smell was there but not in a perfume-y, headache way. It was just herbal. Simple. Like dried lavender in a pouch, not a candle. I went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball.\n\nI didn’t. My face felt… quiet. Not tight. Not oily. Just calm. My pillowcase was fine. Weird.\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nLook, I’m not a scientist. I just read stuff. But the logic tracks when you think about it. For centuries, tallow was the go-to for skin. It’s stable, it’s nourishing, it’s free if you’ve got a cow. Modern skincare took a hard left into the lab and we ended up with a million ingredients we can’t pronounce. Some are great! But for some of us with skin that’s sensitive or just plain difficult, all those chemicals can be like throwing a party nobody wanted.\n\nTallow is simple. Grass-fed beef tallow is full of vitamins A, D, E, and K, and something called conjugated linoleic acid, which is supposed to be anti-inflammatory. Since it’s so similar to our own sebum, it’s supposed to help balance things out. It tells your skin it can chill out on producing so much oil because the backup has arrived. Or it gives dry skin the building blocks it’s missing. I don’t know the exact mechanics. I just know my skin stopped freaking out.\n\nIt’s especially good for winter. The air is dry, the heat’s on, and my skin usually declares mutiny. Elbows like sandpaper, knuckles cracking. I’ve used this tallow balm on all of it. My hands haven’t looked this normal since I was a kid and didn’t care about hand cream. It’s that kind of simple, deep moisture. Not a surface-level gloss.\n\n## What This Lavender Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nSo the lavender part. It’s not just for smell, though that’s a bonus. Lavender’s one of those herbs people have used forever to chill out. This balm has become my night thing. I keep it on my nightstand. The ritual of putting it on—warming it in my hands, the quiet herbal smell—it signals to my brain that the day is done. It’s time to shut off. Is it magic sleep potion? No. But it’s a nice, sensory cue. My anxiety brain appreciates a cue.\n\nAs for the tallow skincare benefits, for me, it’s all about repair. I have these dry, sensitive patches that get red and angry. Psoriasis runs in the family, so my skin is always looking for a reason to throw a fit. Since I’ve been using this, those patches have just… settled down. The redness fades faster. The flakiness stops. It’s not a dramatic overnight cure, but a consistent “oh, things are better now” feeling. It feels like it’s helping my skin fix itself, not just covering up the problem.\n\nI got mine from this Etsy shop, Malti. The jar is small but a little goes a long way. I’ve been using it for weeks and I’ve barely made a dent. It’s just honest, simple stuff. No filler.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks\n\nI’m on my second beer now. And my skin is just… fine. That’s the best way to put it. It’s not “glowing” in some Instagram way. It’s not perfect. But it’s *fine*. It’s not tight after I wash it. It doesn’t get that midday oil slick on my nose. The chronic dry spot on my cheekbone is gone. My hands don’t look like a lizard’s.\n\nI even used it on a minor burn I got from the oven rack last week. Healed up quick, no weird marks. It’s just a versatile, deeply soothing product. I told my mom about it. She’s into all that natural remedy stuff and she just nodded like “yeah, of course, we used lard on our hands in the winter.” See? Grandma wisdom.\n\nThe only downside is explaining it to people. “What’s that smell?” “Oh, just my beef fat lavender cream.” Cue the confused looks. But then I make them feel the back of my hand. They’re always surprised. “Oh, that’s just… soft.”\n\n## Would I Buy It Again?\n\nYeah. I already am. I’m probably gonna order another jar soon just to have as backup. I don’t use it every single day anymore because my skin doesn’t need it every day. That’s the point, I think. It helped my skin get back to a place where it can handle itself. Now I use it when I feel dry, or as my night cream, or on my elbows and knees. It’s my fix-it balm.\n\nIt’s not a miracle. But it’s a really, really good, simple solution that makes a surprising amount of sense once you get past the “ew” factor. Which, honestly, disappears the second you use it. It feels more natural than half the “natural” products out there.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, or you’re just tired of complicated routines, it might be worth a shot. I was skeptical too. Now I’m just a person with a jar of whipped beef fat on my nightstand, and honestly? I’m okay with that.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, for a lot of people. It sounds wild, but it’s because the fat composition is really close to our skin’s own oils. Your skin knows what to do with it. It absorbs instead of sitting on top. Great for dry or sensitive skin.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nIt shouldn’t. Non-comedogenic means it won’t clog pores, and because tallow is so similar to sebum, it’s generally considered non-comedogenic. It absorbs cleanly. My breakout-prone areas have been totally fine with it.\n\n**What does lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nJust straight-up dried lavender. Not sweet, not perfumey. It’s a clean, herbal, kinda earthy smell. It’s calming. Fades pretty quickly after you put it on, just leaves your skin feeling good.",
