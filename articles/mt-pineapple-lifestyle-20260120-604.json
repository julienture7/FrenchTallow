  "body": "Okay so I was just sitting there. It was a Tuesday night, maybe Wednesday. The heater was making that clicking noise it does and my face felt like it was made of old paper. You know that winter feeling. Tight. Like if I smiled too big something would crack. I’d just spent like, I don’t even want to say, a stupid amount at Sephora on this fancy cream that came in a jar the size of a thimble. It smelled like a spa and did absolutely nothing. My knuckles were red. My lips were peeling. I was scrolling, annoyed, and I saw this thing about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your skin.\n\nI laughed. Out loud. My cat looked at me. I’m not a crunchy person. I buy the normal stuff. But I was so sick of the normal stuff not working. So I clicked on this Etsy shop, L’Atelier du Suif or something French like that. They had a whipped tallow balm in pineapple scent. Pineapple. In January. It sounded so ridiculous I almost closed the tab. But it was like thirty bucks with shipping. Which is less than half a thimble of the fancy nothing-cream. And the description said it was grass-fed beef suet, whipped, made in France. For chapped skin, eczema, fine lines. I was skeptical. So skeptical. But also desperate. And curious in a “this is probably a terrible idea” way. I ordered it. A whipped beef tallow balm. For my face. In pineapple.\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face\n\nIt showed up a week later. Small jar. Simple label. I opened it in my kitchen, under the weird fluorescent light. I braced for, I don’t know, a meat locker smell. Or a weird chemical pineapple.\n\nIt didn’t smell like that. It smelled like… pineapple. But not a Jolly Rancher. More like if you walked past a fruit stand on a hot day. Sweet but real. Not fake. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It looked solid in the jar but when I scooped a bit with my finger it just… melted. Like it disappeared on contact. I rubbed it between my palms. It went from a balm to almost nothing. No greasy film. Just soft. My hands felt soft. Immediately.\n\nI stood there for a minute. Holding my own hands. This was bizarre.\n\nThat night, after washing my face with my usual drugstore cleanser (the Cetaphil one in the big pump bottle, you know the one), I stared at the little jar. “Alright,” I said to myself. “Beef fat face time.” I took a tiny bit, smaller than a pea. Pressed it between my fingers to warm it up, then just… patted it all over my face. My cheeks. My forehead. My stupid dry patches near my nose.\n\nI waited for the breakout. The clogged pores. The shiny greaseball look.\n\nIt just sank in. My skin drank it. It felt… calm. Not moisturized in a “I just applied something” way. More like it wasn’t screaming for moisture anymore. I went to bed expecting to wake up a pizza face.\n\nI woke up and my face wasn’t red. For the first time in weeks. The tight, papery feeling was gone. Not replaced by grease. Just gone. My skin felt like my skin, but from like five years ago. I was confused. And weirdly excited. I told my partner over coffee. “I put beef fat on my face last night.” He spit out his coffee. But then he felt my cheek. “Huh,” he said. “It’s… smooth.”\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nSo I started reading about it. Because this made no sense. I’m switching to natural products? Me? The person who buys microwave meals?\n\nTurns out, tallow—the rendered fat from cows—is structurally really close to the oils our own skin makes. The sebum. So when you put it on, your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a silicone-based lotion creating a fake barrier. It gets absorbed. Actually absorbed. It’s like giving your skin back what the winter air and harsh cleansers strip away. This stuff from L’Atelier du Suif is whipped, which makes it light, almost airy. Not what you picture when you think “cow fat.”\n\nI started using it as my only moisturizer. Morning and night. This pineapple tallow balm became my whole natural skincare routine. I’d do my cleanse, pat dry, and then just the balm. That’s it. I stopped using the seven other serums and potions. My bathroom counter got less cluttered.\n\nThe big test was my hands. From washing them constantly and the dry air, they were a mess. Red, cracked, itchy. I started slathering this tallow balm on them before bed. Not a little. A big glob. I’d put on some old cotton gloves I found in a drawer. Sleep like that. Within three nights, the cracks on my knuckles started to heal. The itching stopped. It wasn’t a miracle. It was just… fixing the problem. Deeply. My daily use of this stuff became kind of a ritual. A weird, pineapple-scented, beef-based ritual that actually worked.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI don’t want to say it transformed me. I didn’t look twenty again. That’s not real.\n\nBut the real results were undeniable. The constant winter redness on my cheeks? Gone. The flaky patch by my eyebrow that I’ve had for years? History. My lips stopped peeling. I even put a tiny bit on this old eczema spot on my elbow on a whim, and it calmed down in a couple days. The fine lines around my eyes—the ones that look worse when I’m dehydrated—they just looked… less noticeable. Not erased. Just softer. Like my skin was finally hydrated from the inside out, not just coated on top.\n\nThe best part was how simple it was. One jar. One step. No waiting for layers to dry. No pilling under makeup. I’d put it on, let it sink in for a minute, and my foundation went on smoother than ever. No dry patches to catch on.\n\nI became that person. I was at my mom’s house and she was complaining about her winter hands. “Here,” I said, pulling the little jar out of my bag. “Try this.” She looked at the label. “Beef tallow? Marie, what is this?” But she tried it. The next day she texted me: “What was that stuff? My cuticles look better.” I sent her the Etsy link.\n\nI’m on my second jar now. The first one lasted me almost two months, using it twice a day on my face and on my hands at night. For thirty bucks? That’s cheaper than any pharmacy cream that ever worked half as well.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. Obviously. I already did.\n\nLook, it’s still a weird concept. Telling people “my moisturizer is whipped cow fat” gets some interesting looks. But I don’t care. My skin hasn’t felt this normal, this not-problematic, in I can’t remember how long. It’s just balanced. It doesn’t feel like a chore anymore.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s science, I guess. Giving your skin something it actually knows what to do with. This particular one smells like a vacation, which in the dead of winter is a nice little bonus. A little tropical escape in a jar. It cheers me up.\n\nIf you’re tired of the cycle of dry, slather on cream, still dry, try a more expensive cream… maybe just try this. It sounds gross. It’s not. It’s just… effective. In a quiet, simple way. My whole skincare philosophy now is just: cleanse, tallow balm, done. It’s free-ing.\n\nAnyway. My skin’s happy. I’m not constantly thinking about it or buying new products. That’s the real win.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly. Because it’s so similar to the oils our skin makes naturally, it absorbs really well instead of sitting on top. It’s like giving your skin back what it’s lost. My face just stopped being angry all the time once I started using it.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was terrified of this. But no, for me it didn’t. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. The whipped texture is light and it just sinks in. My skin actually cleared up a bit, probably because it was finally properly hydrated and not freaking out.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like actual pineapple, not candy. Like the fruit itself. It’s sweet and bright and fruity but not overpowering or fake. It fades pretty quickly after you put it on, but for a minute there, it’s a nice little tropical moment. Especially in winter.\n\nSo yeah. If your skin is being difficult and the usual stuff isn’t cutting it, this might be worth a shot. I got mine from that little French shop on Etsy, L’Atelier du Suif. I’m probably gonna order a third jar soon, just to have it ready.",
