  "title": "That Pineapple Tallow Balm I Got on Etsy: My Weird Winter Skin Fix",
  "body": "Okay so it’s like 10 PM and I’m sitting here with this little jar of whipped beef fat on my face. Sounds gross, right? I thought so too. But my skin was freaking out this winter—like, tight and flaky and just angry—and I was desperate. I’d tried the expensive stuff, the drugstore stuff, the “clean beauty” stuff that costs as much as my electric bill. Nothing. Then I kept seeing people talk about tallow balm for skin, specifically this whipped tallow balm scented like pineapple from some Etsy shop. Beef fat. For your face. I was skeptical. So skeptical. But I was also out of options and my cheeks felt like sandpaper. So I ordered it. And now, here I am, a few weeks later, typing this with one hand because the other one is kinda greasy from just putting more on my elbows. It’s become this non-negotiable thing in my nightly tallow balm routine. I don’t know how else to say it. It just… works.\n\nThe jar showed up on a Tuesday, I think. No, wait, it was Thursday because I remember I had that awful work call that afternoon and the mail came after. The box was small. The jar itself is this simple glass thing, not fancy. I opened it and poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter that’s been whipped with a mixer for a really long time. It’s solid but if you put your finger in, it just gives way. Smelled like… pineapple? But not like candy. Or like a cleaner. It was just this bright, sweet fruit smell that made me think of a vacation I never took. Cheerful. That’s the word. It smelled cheerful in a way my bathroom definitely was not at 11 PM on a random winter Thursday.\n\n## How I Started Smearing Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nLook, the whole idea of daily skincare with tallow is strange. You’re putting rendered cow fat on your body. I get it. I had to Google “is beef tallow good for your face” like five times before I actually did it. What convinced me was reading that it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes. Our sebum, or whatever. So it’s not some alien chemical—it’s like giving your skin back something it recognizes. This stuff is from grass-fed cows and whipped in France, which sounds fancier than my life, but whatever. I figured if my $80 moisturizer wasn’t cutting it, what’s the harm in trying the $30 jar of fat?\n\nMy first time using it, I was so careful. Like I was handling a bomb. I washed my face with my normal stuff, patted it dry. Then I scooped out the tiniest amount, maybe half the size of a pea. Rubbed it between my fingers to warm it up. It melts fast. Then I just… patted it on. Mostly on my cheeks and forehead where it was driest. I braced for it to feel heavy or greasy or just sit there. But it didn’t. It sort of vanished. Like my skin drank it. My face felt… calm. Not shiny. Not sticky. Just not thirsty anymore. That was the first win. I didn’t wake up with a new face or anything, but my skin didn’t feel like it was going to crack when I smiled. That hadn’t happened in months.\n\n## What My Routine With This Pineapple Stuff Actually Looks Like\n\nI’m not a 10-step routine person. I forget. I get lazy. But this tallow balm stuck because it’s stupid simple. My nighttime thing now is basically: wash face, maybe splash with water if I’m feeling fancy, then the balm. That’s it. I use it on my face, but then I’ll use whatever’s left on my fingers on my knuckles or the back of my hands. Sometimes, if my legs are feeling like a lizard’s from the dry winter heat, I’ll take a bigger scoop and do my knees and elbows. A little goes a seriously long way. This first jar has lasted me ages.\n\nThe scent is the weirdest part, in a good way. It’s this tropical escape in a jar. In the dead of winter, when it’s dark at 4:30 PM and my soul feels gray, rubbing on something that smells like sweet, sunny pineapple is a whole mood. It’s not overpowering. It doesn’t linger for hours. But for those few minutes you’re applying it, it’s just… nice. It doesn’t smell like skincare. It smells like a feeling. A vacation feeling, I guess. My bathroom smells like a poolside drink for a minute and then it fades, and my skin just feels settled.\n\nOh, and I use it in the morning sometimes too. If I wake up and my skin feels tight, I’ll use a tiny, tiny bit—like, barely there—under my sunscreen. It makes everything sit better. No pilling. I’ve even used it to smooth down flyaways in my hair when I was in a pinch. It’s that multi-use. It lives on my nightstand now, next to my water glass and a pile of old receipts.\n\n## The Skin Results I Actually Noticed (Or Didn’t)\n\nSo after a few weeks of this, what changed? I didn’t turn into a dewy goddess. Let’s be real. But the constant tightness? Gone. The flaky patches around my nose and eyebrows? Gone. The sensitive, red bits on my cheeks when I came in from the cold? Way calmer. It’s like my skin barrier decided to stop being so dramatic all the time. I have these fine lines—everyone does—and I’m not saying they vanished, but they look… less thirsty? Like when you overwater a plant and it plumps up. That’s my skin now. Just more content.\n\nThe biggest shocker was my hands. I wash them constantly. In winter, they crack. They hurt. I’ve tried every lotion. They either feel greasy for an hour or do nothing. One night, I just globbed a bunch of this tallow balm on my hands like I was buttering toast, put on some old cotton gloves, and went to sleep. Woke up and my hands were… normal. Not healed-from-battle normal, but soft. No cracks. No burning when I put on hand sanitizer. I started doing that once a week. Game changer. My elbows haven’t been this smooth since I was a kid, I swear.\n\nWould I buy it again? I already did. I got a second jar last week because I was getting low and I didn’t want to run out. I also got one for my mom because she was complaining about her dry skin and I was like, just trust me. She called me confused about the “beef cream” but then she texted me three days later saying her knuckles didn’t hurt. So. Yeah.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. From what I read, it’s similar to the oils our skin makes naturally, so it absorbs really well instead of just sitting on top. It’s like giving your skin something it already knows how to use, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me, and my skin can be finicky. Because it mimics sebum, it seems to absorb and balance things out rather than clog. It’s not like putting Vaseline on your face. It’s way lighter once it sinks in.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like actual, sweet pineapple. Not artificial candy or a strong perfume. It’s bright and fruity and just makes you happy for a minute when you put it on. The scent doesn’t stick around long, which I like.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult this season and you’re tired of stuff that doesn’t work, maybe give a tallow balm a look. I was super skeptical but now I’m just… a person who puts beef tallow on my face and doesn’t think it’s weird anymore. It just works. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it. Might be worth a shot if you’re curious. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
