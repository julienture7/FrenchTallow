  "title": "Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm: I Put Beef Fat on My Face and It Worked",
  "body": "Okay so. I saw this thing online for a tallow balm. Beef tallow. Like, the stuff you cook with. For your skin. My first thought was, obviously, that’s disgusting. Why would I rub steak grease on my face. It sounded like something a weird survivalist uncle would make in his garage. But it was winter, my knuckles were cracking like old paint, and the $40 stuff from the fancy store was doing exactly nothing. It was a Tuesday night, I was scrolling, my heater was making that clicking noise it does. I figured, what’s the worst that could happen. I smell like a kitchen? I already smell like my cat’s food half the time anyway.\n\nSo I got this whipped tallow balm. The bourbon vanilla one. From some little Etsy shop. It arrived in a plain box, no fancy packaging, which I kind of liked. Made it feel less like a scam. I opened it. It looked like... whipped butter. Or frosting. I poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Kind of dense but soft? Like cold buttercream. I smelled it. Smelled like vanilla maybe? Or not. Something. Not beefy. Not at all. That was the first surprise.\n\nAnyway my coffee is getting cold. The point is, I was skeptical as hell. But I tried it. And now I’m on my second jar. Here’s what happened.\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face (And Why It’s Not Weird)\n\nSo I put it on my hands first. Because if I was gonna look stupid, I wanted it to be in private. I scooped a little. It felt cold. Then it warmed up on my skin real fast, turned into this oily-but-not-oily film. I rubbed it in. It absorbed. Like, actually disappeared. My hands didn’t feel greasy. They felt... quiet. That’s the only word. The tight, itchy, cracked feeling just stopped. I sat there for a minute just opening and closing my hands. Weird.\n\nThis made me google things at 11:47 PM. Why would beef tallow for skin work? Turns out it’s not a new, crazy idea. It’s a really, really old one. Like, grandma’s-grandma old. Before petroleum jelly was a thing, people used animal fats. Lard, tallow, bear grease. The science-y bit, which I only half-understand, is that grass-fed beef tallow is structurally close to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a plastic wrap—it gets in there and tells your skin it can chill out on the oil production. It’s like giving your skin a familiar ingredient it already knows how to use. Not some lab-made chemical with sixteen syllables.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s just... logic. If your skin barrier is messed up (hello, winter, dry office air, stress, being alive), you patch it with something similar. This tallow balm is basically that. Whipped beef tallow from grass-fed cows, some oils, some essential stuff for the bourbon vanilla scent. That’s it. No fillers. No water. Just... food for your face. Which still sounds bizarre to say out loud. But my hands weren’t cracking. So I got brave.\n\n## What This Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nI moved to my face. I have skin that can’t decide if it’s dry or oily, so most moisturizers either do nothing or make me look like I’ve been frying donuts. I used a tiny bit of this tallow skincare stuff at night. After washing my face. The scent is... warm. Not like a candle. Not sweet. It’s vanilla, but like the vanilla in an old bookstore. Or the smell of a wooden spoon. Cozy. It doesn’t scream. It just hangs out. Very stress-reducing, actually. You put it on and it’s like a deep breath.\n\nThe texture takes getting used to. You don’t need much. A pea-sized amount for your whole face. You warm it between your fingers and press it in. Don’t rub. Press. It melts. It feels rich but not heavy. And then you go to bed. You wake up. Your face isn’t shiny. It’s just... calm. Plump. Not red. Not angry. Just skin. I started using it on my elbows, my knees, my heels. Anywhere that felt like sandpaper. It fixed my chapped lips in two days. Two. Days. I’ve spent more on lip balm in a month than this whole jar cost.\n\nI told my mom about it. She has eczema. Like, bad. She was horrified. “Beef fat? On my skin?” I gave her my jar. A week later she texted me: “Where did you get this.” That’s it. No punctuation. Just a demand. I sent her the link. She’s bought three jars since. For her, the natural ingredients thing is huge—she can’t use anything with fragrances or weird chemicals. This is just... fat and vanilla. She says it’s the only thing that’s ever made the itchy patches on her arms go away without a prescription. For psoriasis, eczema, all that angry skin stuff... it just seems to tell it to settle down.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nLook. I’m not a skincare person. I forget to wash my face some nights. My routine is non-existent. But this tallow balm became a thing I actually looked forward to. It’s not a chore. It’s a five-second press-and-go. The results aren’t “glowing” or “radiant” in that Instagram way. It’s more subtle. My skin just stopped freaking out. No more random dry patches by my eyebrows. No more tight feeling after a shower. The little flaky bits around my nose? Gone. My foundation sits better. My hands don’t look like they belong to a crypt keeper anymore.\n\nI compared it to the expensive cream I was using before. The one in the fancy glass jar. That one felt nice going on but an hour later my skin was thirsty again. This tallow balm? It lasts. All day on my hands. All night on my face. It’s deeply moisturizing without being greasy. It’s like it fixes the problem instead of just covering it up. I don’t know how else to explain it. It just works. I’m on my second jar now. I keep one by my bed and one in my bag.\n\nOh, and I got it from this Etsy shop, “PureTallow” or something like that. The shop is just one person in France making small batches. It feels good to buy from that instead of some giant corporation. The jar is simple. It feels honest. There’s no marketing fluff. Just a product that does what it says.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly, it is. Because it’s so similar to the oils our skin already makes, it absorbs deep and helps repair your skin barrier. It’s not just sitting on top clogging things. It’s like giving your skin back something it’s lost.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m prone to clogged pores. Since it’s so similar to our own sebum, my skin seems to know what to do with it. It absorbs. It doesn’t feel like a pore-clogging film at all. If you’re worried, start with a tiny bit.\n\n**What does bourbon vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s warm. Like vanilla extract and a little bit of wood. Not sweet like cake. It’s comforting and classic. It doesn’t smell like food or beef—just a really nice, subtle, cozy scent that fades pretty quickly after you put it on.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow skincare story. I went from “ew, beef fat” to buying it for my mom. If your skin is being difficult, especially in the winter, it might be worth a shot. It’s one of those simple, old-school things that just... works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. I’m probably gonna order another one soon.",
