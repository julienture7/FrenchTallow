  "title": "Pineapple Tallow Balm: What Actually Happened to My Skin This Winter",
  "body": "Look, my face was just… done. It was like, the middle of January. Everything was gray. My skin felt like that weird paper you get in cheap notebooks. You know the one. Sort of tight and crinkly at the same time. I was using this fancy moisturizer from that place in the mall. The blue jar. Cost, I don’t know, maybe forty bucks? It smelled like a department store. And it just sat there. On top of my skin. Doing nothing. My knuckles were cracking. Little red lines. It sucked.\n\nSo I’m scrolling, right. Half-watching some cooking show. And I see this thing about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I almost laughed. I mean, come on. But the algorithm, man. It just kept showing me. This little Etsy shop. All these pictures of whipped stuff in jars. One said “Pineapple.” Looked like sunshine in a container. Which, in January, felt like a personal attack. But also kind of tempting. A tropical escape in a skincare product? I was skeptical. Obviously. But my forty-dollar blue jar was a fancy paperweight. So I clicked. It was like, twenty-two bucks. Free shipping. I figured, what’s the worst that could happen. I ordered the pineapple tallow balm. A whipped beef tallow balm, they said. Made from grass-fed stuff. Whipped up in France. The whole thing.\n\n## How Beef Tallow Ended Up on My Nightstand\n\nIt showed up a week later. In a little brown box. I opened it on my kitchen counter. The jar was smaller than I thought. Cute, though. I unscrewed the lid. The smell hit me first. Not beef fat. Thank god. It was… pineapple. But not like candy. Or cleaner. It was sweeter. Like the fruit itself, but if the fruit was in a good mood. Cheerful. It just made me think of summer. Of not wearing three layers. Vacation feeling, right in my dumb cold apartment. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It was super whipped. Like if butter and clouds had a baby. I poked it. It was firm but soft. I scooped a tiny bit. Rubbed it between my fingers. Cold at first. Then it just… melted. Into nothing. No greasy film. Just gone. Weird.\n\nI put it on the back of my hand. Watched TV for like twenty minutes. Forgot about it. Then I looked down. My skin looked… quiet. Not shiny. Not “moisturized” in that obvious way. Just normal. Like skin is supposed to look. Huh.\n\nSo that night, I washed my face. Used my regular stuff. Took a pea-sized bit of the tallow. Braced myself. Rubbed it on my cheeks, my forehead. It felt… fine. A little slick for a second, then it sank in. Honestly, it just sank in. I went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball. Or smelling like a barbecue. I woke up. Touched my face. It was… soft. Not “product” soft. My skin soft. I didn’t need to immediately slather on more cream. That was new.\n\n## What This Pineapple Stuff Actually Does\n\nI started using it every night. Part of my natural skincare routine, I guess. Didn’t plan it. It just happened because the jar was right there. Switching to natural products wasn’t some big moral thing for me. I just wanted my face to stop hurting. This tallow balm for daily use became the thing I reached for.\n\nHere’s the real talk. It’s not magic. I didn’t transform into a dewy goddess. But the little stuff stopped. The tight feeling after I showered? Gone. That dry patch next to my nose that always flaked under makeup? Just… smoothed out. My hands. God, my hands. I keep a little sample jar by the sink now. After dishes. That’s it. No more cracks. I told my mom about it. She gets bad eczema on her elbows in the winter. I gave her my sample. She texted me last week: “What was that pineapple cream? My elbows are better.” I mean.\n\nI read up on it later. Why beef tallow for skin makes sense. Apparently, it’s really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So it absorbs deep. Doesn’t just coat the top. It’s like it speaks the same language as your face. My fancy blue jar was just yelling in a foreign language. Sitting on the surface. This stuff? It just gets it. It’s good for winter damage. For chapped lips—I put a tiny bit on at night, woke up with lips that didn’t feel like sandpaper. For the first time in years.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This\n\nThe real test was a Tuesday. I think it was Tuesday. Really cold, windy day. I had to walk like six blocks. The kind of wind that feels like it’s sanding your face off. I got inside. My face would usually be screaming. Red, tight, angry. I touched my cheek. It was… fine. A little cool. But not tight. Not burning. Just skin. I stood there in my hallway for a second like an idiot. That’s when I knew. This wasn’t a fluke.\n\nI’m not a skincare person. I don’t have a ten-step routine. I have a tallow balm and a cleanser now. That’s it. My bathroom counter is weirdly empty. I threw out the blue jar. The one from the mall. Felt kinda good, honestly. This little jar of whipped beef fat from France, from that Etsy shop, did what a shelf of expensive stuff couldn’t. It just fixed the baseline. Made my skin feel normal. Resilient. Not perfect. Just okay. And in the winter, okay is a huge win.\n\nIt’s also just a nice moment. At the end of the day. The smell of that pineapple tallow balm. It’s silly. But it’s a two-second vacation. A sweet, fruity little reminder that summer exists. In my bleak January bedroom. That’s worth something too.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly. From what I get, it’s close to what our skin already produces. So it absorbs really well, doesn’t just sit on top clogging things up. It’s like giving your skin something it actually recognizes and knows how to use. My face seems to think so, anyway.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores pretty easy. I think because it melts in and doesn’t leave a greasy layer, it’s less likely to. It’s not like putting Vaseline on your face. It goes in. My skin just drinks it up.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nLike actual pineapple. The good, ripe kind. Not fake candy smell or a strong perfume. It’s sweet and fruity and just… happy. It doesn’t stick around all night, but when you put it on, it’s a nice little tropical hit. Makes the whole thing feel less clinical.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow story. I was super skeptical. Now I’m just… using it. My skin’s not dramatic about winter anymore. It just is. If your skin’s being difficult, and the fancy stuff isn’t cutting it, maybe give the beef fat a shot. Sounds nuts. But it just works. I don’t know what else to say. I’m probably gonna order another jar soon.",
