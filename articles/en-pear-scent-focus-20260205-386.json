  "title": "That Pear Tallow Balm I Got on Etsy: My Skin Stopped Freaking Out",
  "body": "Okay so I was just sitting there, you know, after washing my face. It was like 9 PM on a Tuesday. My phone was buzzing with some group text I was ignoring, battery at like 12%, and my skin felt… tight. That weird winter tightness, like your face is a drum. I’d tried a bunch of stuff. Expensive stuff in fancy jars. Stuff that smelled like a spa. My skin just got angrier. Red patches. Flaky bits near my eyebrows. A whole thing.\n\nI kept seeing people talk about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I mean, come on. It sounded like something my great-grandmother would have used, not something you order online. But my skin was so mad at me, and I was out of ideas. So I figured, whatever, let’s try the beef fat. I found this little shop on Etsy. The one I got was their Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear. Sounded less intimidating than the plain one. A pear tallow balm. Weird combo. I clicked buy.\n\nIt showed up in this small jar. I opened it. Here’s the thing about the scent—it’s not like a candle or lotion. It’s not screaming PEAR JUICE. It’s just… nice. Light. Fresh but not in a cleaning product way. It smells like if you walked past a pear tree on a cold day, and you just got a little whiff of it. Not sweet like candy. Just a clean, gentle fruity smell. It doesn’t smell like beef at all, which was my first worry. It just smells good. Simple. It makes the whole idea of rubbing rendered cow fat on your face feel less medieval.\n\n## Why I Even Tried Beef Tallow Skincare\n\nLook, I was skeptical. My routine was a graveyard of bottles that promised “glass skin” and delivered a shiny forehead and dry cheeks. I’d read that tallow, especially from grass-fed cows, is weirdly similar to the oils our own skin makes. Like, the structure of it is close to human sebum. So instead of just sitting on top of your skin or clogging things up, it’s supposed to sink in and tell your skin it can chill out, stop over-producing oil to compensate for being so dry. It made a kind of sense, in a gross way. Mimics human skin sebum, they said. Deep absorption. I was desperate enough for that to sound like science and not madness.\n\nAlso, it was winter. The air in my apartment is drier than toast. My hands looked like a topographic map of the moon. My knuckles would crack. I needed something heavy-duty but that wouldn’t make me feel like I’d dipped my face in a fryer. This natural pear skincare thing, this scented tallow balm, it was my Hail Mary.\n\n## What Using This Stuff Is Actually Like\n\nThe texture is weird. Good weird. It’s whipped, so it’s not a hard chunk of fat. It’s like… cool butter? But softer. You scoop a tiny bit with your finger—a little goes a long way, which is good because the jar isn’t huge—and it melts immediately from your body heat. I rub it between my palms first.\n\nThen I just press it into my face. Don’t rub hard, just press. It feels rich. It looks shiny for a minute. I’d sit there on the couch, half-watching some baking show rerun, feeling my skin drink it up. Within maybe five, ten minutes, the shine is gone. It’s just gone. It doesn’t feel greasy. It doesn’t feel like anything, which is the best part. My skin just feels… quiet. Not tight. Not oily. Just normal. Like skin is supposed to feel, I guess.\n\nI started using it at night. After I wash my face, that’s it. Just this pear tallow balm. Sometimes if my hands were really bad, I’d use it on them too. It became this little ritual. The scent is so light and pleasant, it’s not a perfume-y thing that gives you a headache. It’s just a nice little moment. Open the jar, get that gentle smell, and know my skin’s about to get a break. I started looking forward to it. A two-minute act of peace in a dumb day.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This\n\nSo I didn’t expect a miracle. I really didn’t.\n\nBut get this. After about a week, the red patches on my cheeks? Calmer. Less angry. After two weeks, the flaky skin around my eyebrows and nose just… stopped. It was gone. My skin wasn’t perfect—I still get a stress pimple—but the overall texture was smoother. More even. It just felt healthier. Like it had what it needed.\n\nThe biggest shock was my hands. I work on a computer all day, wash my hands a bunch. Winter is brutal. I used the balm on my knuckles before bed. The cracks healed. My hands stopped looking like they belonged to a desert hermit. They were just… hands again. Soft, but not in a weird lotion-y film way. Just normal.\n\nI told my sister about it. She was like, “You put what on your face?” I made her try it. She called me two days later asking for the Etsy link. That’s the real test, right? When you make your skeptical sister a believer. The shop is called [Your Etsy Shop Name Here - mention naturally]. It’s just one person, I think, making this stuff in France. Feels better than buying from some giant factory.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pear Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nI’m on my second jar. The first one lasted me a good couple of months, using it almost every night. It sits on my bathroom counter next to my toothbrush. It’s not fancy. The label is simple. But it works. It just does.\n\nFor me, the pear scent is key. It makes the experience feel a little special, not clinical. It’s a subtle sweetness that’s just… pleasant. It doesn’t fight with anything. It’s just a light, fresh, fruity scent that makes putting on moisturizer feel a tiny bit nicer. I’ve tried the unscented version too, which is fine, but I miss the pear. It’s my thing now.\n\nI don’t have a ten-step routine anymore. I just wash my face and use this. My skin is the most balanced it’s been in years. Maybe ever. I spent so much money trying to fix my skin with complicated science, and the answer was apparently very old, very simple, and smelled like fruit.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is feeling tight or angry or just off, especially in this dry winter air, maybe give a tallow balm a look. If you’re curious about a scented one, the pear version is genuinely lovely. It’s hydrating in a deep way, not a surface way. It’s good for dry skin, rough hands, sensitive skin like mine. It just works. I don’t know what else to say.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. From what I understand, the fat from grass-fed cows has a structure that’s really similar to the oils our own skin makes. So it absorbs well and helps balance things out. It’s not just sitting there clogging pores. My face seems to think it’s great.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nIt hasn’t for me, and I’m pretty prone to congestion. It absorbs fully. It’s not like petroleum jelly that just sits on top. It sinks in. My pores actually look better, not worse.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light. It’s not a strong perfume. It’s like the smell of a fresh pear, but gentle and clean. Not sugary. Just a soft, fresh, fruity scent that makes using it feel nice. It’s subtle and sophisticated in a very low-key way.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my experience. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. Might be worth a shot if you’re looking for something that actually works.",
