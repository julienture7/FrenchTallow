  "title": "My Phone's at 12% and I'm Talking About Beef Fat for My Face",
  "body": "So my skin was just… done. This winter. I’m talking flaky patches on my cheeks that felt like sandpaper, this tight feeling all the time like my face was shrinking, and the area around my nose? A red, angry mess. I was using this expensive cream from that fancy department store brand, you know the one in the blue jar that costs as much as a car payment. It did nothing. Felt like I was smearing cold butter on a brick wall. Just sat there. My skin drank it up and was still thirsty five minutes later. I was desperate. And then I kept seeing stuff about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I mean, come on. Sounded like something my great-grandma would have used before they invented, you know, actual skincare. But I was scrolling Etsy one night, really late, like 2 AM because I couldn’t sleep and my face hurt, and I found this stuff. A whipped tallow balm. The pear scent one. I figured if I was gonna smear animal fat on myself, it should at least smell kinda nice. So I ordered it. Didn’t tell anyone. Felt a little weird typing in my credit card info for “grass-fed beef tallow skin cream.”\n\n## How I Ended Up Putting Tallow on My Face\n\nLook. I tried everything first. Hyaluronic acid serums that made me feel sticky. Oil blends that just slid around. That thick, goopy stuff in a tub that comes with a little spatula—felt like I was frosting a cake. My own face. A weird, dry, cranky cake. Nothing worked for more than an hour. My skin type is… I don’t know the fancy word. It’s not oily. It’s not super dry. It’s just… difficult. It gets parched and then it gets mad and then it gets red. And in winter, with the heat on all the time, it’s a full-on rebellion.\n\nSo this tallow balm arrives. Small jar. Cute label. Made in France, which for some reason made it feel less like a frontier remedy. I opened it. Texture was weird. Not bad weird. It’s whipped, so it’s super light and airy, but then it’s also… substantial? You scoop a tiny bit and it melts the second it touches your skin. Like, immediately. Doesn’t feel greasy. Doesn’t feel like fat. Feels like… nothing. But in a good way. The smell is… okay, this is hard. It’s not a strong “PEAR!” smell. It’s just this gentle, fresh, kinda sweet thing. Not perfume-y. Not like candy. Just nice. Subtle. You have to really sniff it to get it. Anyway.\n\nI put it on at night. After I washed my face. Just a little dab for each cheek, forehead, chin. Rubbed it in. Went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball.\n\nI did not wake up a greaseball.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nI woke up and my face felt… calm. That’s the only word. Not “moisturized” in that heavy, product-y way. Just calm. The tightness was gone. The sandpaper patches? Smoother. Not perfect, but better. Like, noticeably better after one use. That never happens.\n\nSo I kept using it. Morning and night. Here’s the thing about beef tallow for skin—and I looked this up after because I was curious—it’s supposed to be really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Sebum. So it just… gets it. It absorbs. It doesn’t just sit on top pretending to do a job. It goes in and does the job. My skin stopped feeling like it was fighting me. The red, angry ring around my nose? Started fading after like, three days. I was shocked. Honestly.\n\nI started using it on my hands too. Because why not. They get destroyed in winter. Cracks by the knuckles. I’d put a little blob on the back of my hands before bed. Woke up and they were… fine. Not miraculously baby-soft, but the cracks were healing. They didn’t hurt when I washed them. That was a big deal.\n\nIs it the best tallow for dry, angry skin? I don’t know, it’s the only one I’ve tried. But for my difficult, winter-hating skin, it’s been a game-changer. And I hate that phrase, but it’s true. My skin just… stopped complaining. It’s hydrated. It’s not freaking out. I can wear a little makeup over it and it doesn’t get all cakey and weird. It just behaves.\n\n## My Skin Now, a Few Weeks In\n\nI’m almost out of the jar. Gonna order another one. That’s the real review, right? If you use it up and buy it again.\n\nMy routine is stupid simple now. Wash face. Pat dry. Tiny bit of the pear tallow balm. That’s it. No seven-step routine. No waiting for layers to dry. It takes like 30 seconds. My skin looks… healthy. Not “glowing” in that Instagram way. Just healthy. Like it’s getting what it needs. The fine lines around my eyes—the ones that get more obvious when I’m dehydrated—they’re less… dramatic. They’re still there, I’m not 21, but they don’t look like canyons anymore.\n\nI told my mom about it. She has eczema on her arms sometimes. She was skeptical too. “Beef fat, really?” But she tried a little of mine. Texted me a week later saying her patches were less itchy. She ordered the unscented one. So there’s that.\n\nI got mine from this little shop on Etsy. The jar lasted a good while because you need so little. It’s not cheap, but it’s not that crazy blue-jar cream price either. And it actually works. For me, that math adds up. I’d spent way more on a cabinet full of stuff that didn’t work.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly, it is. From what I read, it’s compatible with our skin’s natural stuff. It absorbs deep instead of sitting on top. My face seems to think it’s good, anyway.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And my skin usually throws a fit if I use anything too heavy. This just sinks in. Doesn’t feel cloggy at all. It’s not like rubbing bacon grease on yourself, which is what I pictured.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light. Really light. A soft, fresh sweetness. Not like a Jolly Rancher. More like the idea of a pear. It’s nice. Fades pretty quick after you put it on.\n\nSo yeah. If your skin is being difficult, especially in the winter, and you’ve tried the usual stuff that just isn’t cutting it… this might be worth a shot. This natural moisturizer for dry, fussy skin just… worked. I was skeptical. Now I’m just a person with a jar of whipped tallow on my nightstand. And happier skin. That’s it.",
