  "title": "My Pineapple Tallow Balm Experiment: Or, How Beef Fat Fixed My Face",
  "body": "Okay so. I was done. Like, completely over it. This was back in, I don't know, November? It was cold. My skin was this weird combination of tight and flaky but also somehow greasy in the wrong places. You know that feeling. I’d been using this fancy cream from a blue jar, you know the one, it’s like a hundred dollars and smells like a grandma’s funeral. Cerave? No, the other one. La Mer? Something like that. A gift. Felt like spreading cold butter on my face and just sat there. Shiny. Did nothing. My cheeks were still rough, like sandpaper. I was so mad. Spent all that money and my face still felt like a lizard. Anyway. I was scrolling, my foot was asleep from sitting weird, and I saw this thing about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I laughed. Out loud. My dog looked at me. But I was desperate. And curious. So I clicked on this Etsy shop, found one scented like pineapple, and thought… why the hell not. A tropical escape in a jar while my heating bill is trying to kill me. Let’s do it.\n\n## How I Ended Up Putting Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nLook, the whole natural vs commercial skincare thing is exhausting. Everyone’s yelling. One side says you need seventeen serums with unpronounceable names. The other says you should wash your face with honey and sunlight. I’m in the middle. I just want my skin to not hurt. The commercial stuff, the lotions from the drugstore? They’re mostly water. And weird thickeners. And fragrance that makes me sneeze. They feel okay for a second then it’s like your skin just drinks it and asks for more an hour later. It’s a trap. You keep applying. The bottle empties. You buy another. The cycle continues. My bathroom cabinet was a graveyard of half-used bottles that promised “radiance” and delivered zilch. So the idea of a whipped beef tallow balm, specifically this pineapple one made in France from grass-fed cows, was so bizarre it almost made sense. If it’s supposed to mimic the oils my skin already makes… maybe it’ll actually listen to it? I don’t know the science. I just knew my $100 cream was a fancy paperweight.\n\nThe whole “mimics human sebum” thing got me. Because that’s what my skin is desperately trying to make, right? Especially in winter. And I’m out here stripping it all away with harsh stuff and then slapping on a bunch of alien chemicals trying to replace it. Seemed stupid when I thought about it like that. So I ordered the jar. It felt like ordering a secret. Or a science experiment.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt arrived in a little box. Cute jar. Opened it up. Texture was… weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter that’s been whipped with a mixer for a really long time. Fluffy but dense. You scoop a tiny bit with your finger and it melts immediately from your body heat. That part was cool. Smelled like. I don’t know. Pineapple? But not a piña colada. Not candy. Like if you smelled a pineapple from across the kitchen. A sweet fruit smell but quiet. Cheerful. It made me smile, which is a weird thing to say about a face cream. Vacation in a bottle. In December. During a rainstorm.\n\nI put it on at night. After I washed my face. Just a little dab for my whole face. Rubbed my hands together first. It went on kind of… oily. I panicked for a second. “Great,” I thought. “Now I’m just a greasy liar.” But I left it. Went to bed feeling slick. Woke up expecting a pillowcase disaster and a new zit.\n\nHere’s the thing. My skin drank it. Overnight. No grease. No pillow mess. My face just felt… calm. Not tight. Not thirsty. Not screaming at me. Just quiet. Like it had finally gotten what it wanted and was now napping peacefully. That never happened with the fancy cream. That stuff just decorated the surface. This pineapple tallow balm went in. I started using it every night. And then in the morning too, under my makeup. A tiny bit. It just vanished. No pilling. No weird separation. My foundation actually sat better on top. Less cakey.\n\nThe real test was my hands. Winter destroys my hands. They crack by my thumbs. Bleed sometimes. I started using the balm on them. After dishes. Before bed. The cracks healed. Like, actually closed up. No more stinging when I used hand sanitizer. That was the moment I was like, oh. This isn’t a gimmick. This beef tallow skincare thing is fixing the actual problem. Not masking it.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI don’t want to sound like an infomercial. I’m just a person on a couch. But the difference was stupidly obvious. My lizard cheeks are gone. Smooth. Not “silky” or whatever. Just normal skin texture. The dry, flaky patches around my nose? Gone. The eczema spot on my elbow I’ve had since high school? It’s… less angry. It’s not a miracle cure, it’s still there, but it doesn’t itch like a fire ant bite anymore. I put the balm on it and it chills out.\n\nI used it on my chapped lips too. Worked better than any waxy tube I’ve ever bought. It absorbs. It doesn’t just sit on top waiting to be licked off.\n\nThe best part is I use so little. This jar is going to last forever. With the other lotions, I was doing a full pump for each limb. Now it’s a dab the size of a pea for my whole face. So even though it seems pricier upfront, it’s not. Because you’re not reapplying all day. Your skin is just… satisfied. It’s a weird feeling. To not think about your skin. I’d forgotten what that was like.\n\nI told my sister about it. She called me a hippie. Then she tried it when she visited. She took a photo of the Etsy shop listing before she left. So.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did. I’m on my second jar. The first one is almost gone, just scraping the sides. I got it from the same little Etsy shop, the one that makes it in France. I didn’t even look for anything else. Why would I? This works. My skin is happy. It smells like a tiny summer holiday when I open it. It’s simple. One ingredient doing the job of ten.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s not going to turn back time. But if your skin is dry, or angry, or just confused from all the products you’ve thrown at it… this might be the reset button. A little whipped beef tallow balm, some pineapple smell, and patience. It just makes sense in a way that a bottle of chemical soup never will.\n\nAnyway. My skin’s not perfect. But it’s mine again. And it doesn’t hurt. That’s the big thing. For me, that’s everything.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nSeems to be, yeah. From what I read, it’s really similar to the oils our own skin produces. So it recognizes it and knows what to do with it. It absorbs deep instead of sitting on top. My face definitely thinks it’s good.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about that. But nope. Not for me. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog stuff. It feels like it melts right in and feeds your skin, not your pores. If you’re super acne-prone maybe patch test first, but for my combo skin it’s been fine.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s nice! Not fake or strong. Not like candy. Just a clean, sweet, fruity smell. Like the idea of a pineapple. It’s cheerful. Fades pretty quick after you put it on, just leaves your skin feeling good, not perfumed.\n\nSo yeah. If your skin’s being difficult and you’re tired of the lotion cycle, this might be worth a shot. I’m just glad I tried it.",
