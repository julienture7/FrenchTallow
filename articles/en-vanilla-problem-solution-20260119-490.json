  "title": "That Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm: What Actually Happened to My Skin",
  "body": "Look. My face was a disaster. It was last Tuesday, no wait, it was Thursday, because I remember the garbage truck was super loud that morning. My skin felt like one of those old paper bags you find in the back of a pantry. You know the ones. Crinkly. Tight. If I smiled it felt like it might just crack right off. I’d tried everything. The fancy La Mer cream my sister swore by. The CeraVe stuff from the drugstore. The Korean serum that had like twelve steps. Nothing. My skin just drank it up and asked for more and then went back to being a desert. A sad, flaky desert. I was sitting there, in my kitchen with the weird hum from the fridge, wearing my oldest sweatshirt, and I just googled “dry skin help” again. That’s how I found this whole tallow balm thing. Beef tallow skincare. Sounded absolutely insane. Putting beef fat on my face? I’m not a pioneer. I order groceries online. But I was desperate. And one Etsy shop kept popping up for this Whipped Tallow Balm in Bourbon Vanilla. Warm, cozy scent, they said. Good for dry skin, they said. Made in France, which felt fancy. I was skeptical. So skeptical. But my credit card was already out.\n\n## How I Ended Up Putting Beef Fat on My Face\n\nSo the jar showed up. Small. Kind of cute, honestly. I opened it right there by the mailbox. It was cold out, my fingers were freezing. The texture was… weird. Not bad weird. Thick. Like really thick. But when I scooped a little it was soft. It smelled like vanilla maybe? Or not. Something. Like vanilla extract spilled on a warm leather chair. That’s the best I can do. I don’t know how to describe it. It was just… nice. Not perfume-y. I stood there for a second, holding this jar of whipped beef tallow from grass-fed cows, made in France, and I thought well this is a sentence I never thought I’d think. I brought it inside. Washed my face with my normal stuff, the Cetaphil gentle cleanser, patted it dry. My skin was already starting to feel that tight, angry pull. I took the tiniest bit. Rubbed it between my palms. It melted. Like instantly. Went from this dense balm to almost an oil. I just patted it all over my face. Braced for the grease.\n\nIt never came.\n\nThat was the first surprise. It just… went in. My skin drank it. There was no shiny film, no slick feeling. It was gone. And my face felt… calm. Not moisturized, not yet, but just not angry anymore. The tightness was gone. I poked my cheek. It felt like skin. Not paper. I was confused. I expected to feel like a glazed donut. I felt like a person who just put cream on their face. That was it. I went to bed figuring I’d wake up with seventeen new pimples.\n\n## Why This Tallow Stuff Actually Makes Sense\n\nI didn’t. Wake up with pimples, I mean. My face was still… calm. So I used it again the next morning. And that night. I got curious and started reading about tallow balm for dry skin. Turns out there’s a logic to it, which is not something I usually look for in my skincare but hey. Beef tallow, the good kind from grass-fed cows, is apparently really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So it absorbs deep, doesn’t just sit on top like a silicone blanket. It mimics the skin’s natural barrier. People have used animal fats forever, I guess. Lard, tallow, all that. For eczema, for psoriasis, for just brutally dry winter skin. My winter skin was definitely brutal. The fact that this one was whipped made it fluffy, easier to use than just a block of fat. Which, thank god. I’m not churning butter here. I’m trying to not look like a lizard.\n\nI should probably order another jar soon. The one I got from that Etsy shop, Prairie something, is about half gone. I use it on my elbows too. And my knuckles, which always get red and cracked. My elbows haven’t been this smooth since… I don’t know when. Maybe never. I used to use that O’Keeffe’s Working Hands stuff but it never lasted. This tallow balm, this bourbon vanilla one, it’s different. It’s like it fixes the problem instead of just covering it up for an hour. My skin doesn’t feel thirsty anymore. It just feels… fine. Normal. Which is all I ever wanted.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Routine\n\nOkay so it’s been like a month maybe. I lost track. Time is fake. But my skin is real and it’s better. The flakiness around my nose is gone. Completely. The dry patches on my cheeks that used to catch on foundation? History. I don’t even wear foundation much now because I don’t feel like I need to cover anything up. My face just has this… evenness to it. Not a glow, not a radiance, nothing fancy. It just looks healthy. Like it’s properly hydrated from the inside out, but the hydration is coming from the outside in. I don’t know. It works.\n\nHere’s a random thing. I was on a video call with my mom and she goes “what are you using on your skin? It looks good.” And my mom never says that. She’s more of a “you look tired” person. So I told her. I said “mom, I’m putting cow fat on my face.” She paused. She blinked. Then she said “send me the link.” So I did. And now she’s using it too. On her “crepey” neck, as she calls it. She says it helps. That’s a bigger endorsement than any influencer could give me.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s not going to turn back time or erase wrinkles. But my skin barrier, which I’m pretty sure I destroyed with over-washing and those acidic toners, feels repaired. It feels strong. When the wind hits my face now, it doesn’t sting. It just feels like wind. That’s the victory. Not looking perfect. Just not hurting.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, weirdly, it is. At least for me. The science-y reason is that its fat profile is super close to our own skin oils, so our skin recognizes it and knows what to do with it. It absorbs and helps repair the moisture barrier. It’s a classic natural skincare ingredient, just forgotten for a while.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was terrified of this. But no, not for me. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. Because it absorbs so deeply, it doesn’t sit on top of your skin and gunk things up. My pores actually look smaller because my skin isn’t inflamed and dry.\n\n**What does the Bourbon Vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s warm. Like a vanilla bean, not vanilla cake. There’s a depth to it, kind of cozy. Not sweet. It doesn’t smell like food or perfume. It just smells… good. The scent doesn’t stick around long after you put it on, which I like.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow story. I went from “beef fat, gross” to having a half-empty jar on my nightstand that I use every single day. My skin’s happy, I’m happy, that’s all I wanted. If your skin is being difficult, especially in this dry winter air, it might be worth a shot. I got mine from a little Etsy shop and I’ll probably get another one soon. Anyway. It just works. I don’t know what else to say.",
