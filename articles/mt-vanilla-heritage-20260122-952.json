  "title": "My Weird Winter Thing: That Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm",
  "body": "Okay so. It’s January. My face feels like that one piece of paper you left in your backpack that got all crinkly and weird. You know the one. I was on my phone at like 11:47 PM, just doom-scrolling, and my hands were so dry they were making that… paper sound. Against my phone case. That rough plastic one. Anyway.\n\nI kept seeing this stuff. Tallow balm. Beef tallow skincare. For your face. I was like, beef? Fat? From a cow? On my… face? It sounded like something my weird hippie aunt would have in her fridge next to the kombucha. But the algorithm wouldn’t let me go. It was all “traditional tallow skincare” and “beef tallow history” and how it’s making this whole natural skincare comeback. I got curious. The kind of curious you get when you’re one beer in and your skin hurts.\n\nSo I fell down the rabbit hole. And I ordered some. This Whipped Tallow Balm in Bourbon Vanilla from some little Etsy shop. It arrived in this simple jar. And I’ve been using it for weeks now. Here’s what happened. And why the whole beef fat thing isn’t as crazy as it sounds.\n\n## How Beef Tallow Ended Up on My Bathroom Shelf\n\nLook, I didn’t wake up and think “today I will smear cow fat on myself.” It started with my grandma, sort of. Not that she used it. But she had these… ways. Bag balm for everything. Lard in a tin. That kind of practical, use-what-you-have vibe. She’d say “they don’t make things like they used to” and roll her eyes at my fancy moisturizer bottles.\n\nSo when I kept seeing “traditional tallow skincare,” that phrase stuck. It’s not new. It’s ancient. People have been using animal fats on their skin forever. Before petroleum, before labs in white coats, before a moisturizer cost more than my electric bill. It was just… what worked. Then it got weird and gross-sounding because we got all squeamish and started making everything in factories.\n\nBut the thing is, beef tallow from grass-fed cows, when it’s whipped into this balm… it’s kinda close to our own skin’s sebum. The oil we make. So your skin recognizes it. It absorbs. It doesn’t just sit there like a greasy mask. It goes, “oh hey, I know this guy,” and lets it in. For dry skin relief? For winter damage? It makes this depressing, logical sense that annoyed me. Because now I had to try it.\n\nI got the Bourbon Vanilla one because “warm, comforting, classic, cozy” sounded better than “unscented beef.” I was skeptical. So, so skeptical.\n\n## Opening the Jar for the First Time\n\nIt came on a Tuesday. Maybe Wednesday. The box was cold from the mailbox. I brought it in and just stared at it for a bit. My cat was judging me, I swear.\n\nOpened it. The texture was… weird. Not bad weird. It’s whipped, so it’s like this super dense, kind of creamy paste. But solid. You scoop a tiny bit with your finger and it melts immediately from your body heat. Like that last bit of butter on a hot pancake. Smooth, I guess. Is that the word. Yeah smooth.\n\nThe smell. Bourbon Vanilla. It’s not a candle store smell. It’s not that fake, sugary vanilla. It’s deeper. Warmer. Like vanilla extract your friend who’s way too into baking has in their cupboard. With this… roundness. A cozy smell. It doesn’t scream. It just sits there, all comforting and classic. It actually is stress-reducing. You take a whiff and your shoulders drop half an inch. I didn’t expect that part at all.\n\nI put a tiny dab on my hand. Rubbed it in. It was gone. Like, really gone. No greasy film. No shiny residue. My skin just… drank it. And it felt calm. Not “moisturized” in that slick way. Just calm. Like it stopped being thirsty.\n\nSo I put it on my face that night. Half expecting to wake up looking like a pepperoni pizza.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Weirdness\n\nI didn’t wake up transformed. It’s not magic. It’s maintenance. But after a few days, I noticed my face wasn’t tight when I woke up. That dry, pulling feeling was gone. After a week, the little flaky patches by my eyebrows—gone. The perpetual winter redness on my cheeks? Toned way down.\n\nHere’s the big one for me: my hands. I wash my hands constantly. They crack. They bleed. It’s awful. I’ve tried every lotion in a pump bottle. They either don’t work or they’re so greasy I can’t turn a doorknob. This tallow balm? I put a thicker layer on my knuckles before bed. Absorbs. Doesn’t get all over the sheets. Woke up and the cracks were… just not as angry. Healed faster. My elbows haven’t been this smooth since I was a kid, I don’t know when.\n\nIt’s good for winter damage, for sure. I read it’s good for things like psoriasis and fine lines too, which, hey, I’ll take it. I’m not saying it’s erased my lines. But my skin looks… healthier. Less stressed. More even. It has this quiet glow, not a shine. Like it’s finally hydrated from the inside out.\n\nIt’s become my last step at night. A little scoop, warm it between my fingers, press it in. The bourbon vanilla smell is the last thing I smell before sleep. It’s a ritual now. I look forward to it.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nI’m on my second jar. I got one for my mom for Christmas and she called me last week asking for the link to the Etsy shop. That’s the real test, right?\n\nI’ve spent so much money on fancy creams in glass jars. Ones that promised miracles and smelled like a chemical engineer’s idea of a rainforest. This stuff, made in France from grass-fed beef suet, whipped into this luxurious texture… it just works better. It’s simpler. It’s humbling, in a way. To realize the answer wasn’t more technology, but less. Going back to something traditional that actually works.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. The idea freaks people out. I get it. But if your skin is feeling like that crinkly piece of paper, if the winter air is winning, it might be worth a shot. I didn’t expect to become a person who evangelizes about beef fat. But here I am. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. Because it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes, it absorbs deep and doesn’t just clog stuff up. It’s like giving your skin something it actually knows how to use. Weird but true.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot for most people. It’s non-comedogenic, which is a fancy way of saying it shouldn’t clog pores. It melts and sinks in instead of sitting on top. My fussy skin hasn’t had any issues, and it usually complains about everything.\n\n**What does the Bourbon Vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a warm, cozy vanilla. Not a bakery or a candle. More like real vanilla with a deep, almost smoky roundness to it. It’s comforting. Fades to a soft skin scent pretty quick. Honestly, it’s the best part besides the results.\n\nAnyway. If you’re curious about this whole traditional tallow skincare comeback, might be worth checking out. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that just makes the stuff. No fancy marketing. Just the balm. It just works. I don’t know what else to say.",
