  "title": "Pineapple Tallow Balm: My Weird Winter Skin Thing That Actually Works",
  "body": "Okay so. I was looking for something for my hands. It’s winter, you know? Everything’s dry. My knuckles were cracking. Looked like a map of a desert. I tried the usual stuff. The lotion in the pump bottle by the sink. The fancy cream my sister gave me for Christmas. Nothing. My skin just drank it up and was still thirsty. Then I remembered this jar I bought on a whim. A whipped tallow balm. Pineapple scent. Beef tallow skincare. Sounds weird, right? Putting beef fat on your face. I know. But my grandma used to talk about using lard for her hands when she gardened. So I figured, what’s the difference? Anyway. I’m sitting here, one beer in, my neighbor’s TV is blaring some reality show through the wall, and my hands are finally not hurting. So I’m just typing this out.\n\nIt all started because I fell down an internet rabbit hole. I was looking for “natural skincare comeback” or something like that. Kept seeing “traditional tallow skincare” pop up. People talking about beef tallow history like it was some forgotten secret. I was skeptical. Very. But the logic kind of stuck in my head. They say it mimics human skin sebum. Our own oil. So it absorbs deep. Doesn’t just sit on top. I guess that made sense. My skin’s own oil is probably what it wants, not some lab-made chemical with a long name. So I found this little Etsy shop. French stuff. Grass-fed beef suet, whipped up. They had a pineapple one. “Tropical escape,” it said. Cheerful. Vacation feeling. I bought it thinking it would be a funny story. “Look at this weird thing I put on my face.” I didn’t expect much.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Became My Thing\n\nThe jar showed up on a Tuesday. I think. It was cold out. The box was cold. I opened it and just stared at it for a minute. It’s just… a cream. Looks like any other balm. I unscrewed the lid. Smelled like pineapple. Not fake candy pineapple. More like… pineapple if you were remembering it. Sweet fruit, but not overwhelming. I poked it. Texture was weird. Not bad weird. Thick, but soft. Like if butter and whipped cream had a baby. Cold at first. I rubbed a tiny bit on the back of my hand. It just sank in. No greasy film. No shiny residue. It was gone. And my skin felt… calm. I don’t know how else to say it. Not “moisturized” in that plastic way. Just calm. Like it stopped being angry.\n\nI started using it at night. After washing my face. Just a little scoop. My face has always been a drama queen. Dry patches here, oily spot there. The usual winter mess. This tallow balm just… handled it. I didn’t have to think. I’d put it on and forget about it. No pillow stickiness. No waking up feeling like I had a mask on. My skin just felt like skin. Good skin. The kind you don’t notice. That’s the goal, right? Skin that doesn’t need constant attention.\n\nHere’s the personal history part, I guess. My grandma would tell stories about the Depression. They used everything. Saved bacon grease for cooking, sure, but also for their hands in winter. Rendered fat was just a tool. A good one. It wasn’t a “skincare routine,” it was just what you did to not bleed from your knuckles. So this whole “beef tallow history” thing, this “natural skincare comeback,” it’s not really new. It’s old. We just forgot. We got sold on complicated bottles with French words. And I bought them! I spent so much money. But this jar, this simple thing my grandma would have understood immediately, is what finally worked.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nSo what does it do? It’s not magic. It’s just really good at one job. It gives your skin what it’s missing. Our own sebum. The stuff our skin makes to protect itself. When that’s out of whack—from winter, from stress, from whatever—this steps in. It’s like giving your skin a familiar food instead of a foreign substance.\n\nGood for rough hands? Yeah. My cracking knuckles are gone. I keep the jar by my bed now. Good for eczema or psoriasis? I can’t speak to that personally, but the logic is there. If your skin barrier is messed up, giving it something it recognizes to help repair itself makes a lot of sense. More sense than steroid creams, honestly. For my face, it just balanced everything out. No more dry flakes by my nose. No more tight feeling after a shower. My skin just… exists peacefully now. It’s a low-maintenance relationship.\n\nThe scent is cheerful. Pineapple. It’s not a strong perfume. It’s just a nice little vibe when you open the jar. Summer in the middle of winter. It doesn’t linger on your skin, which I like. I don’t want to smell like a fruit salad all day. I just want my skin to work. The vacation feeling is more for the 30 seconds you’re applying it. A little mental escape. Then it’s gone, and you just have better skin.\n\nI got mine from this Etsy shop, Malti. No fuss. Just a simple jar. Feels like someone made it carefully, not in a huge factory. I like that.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nThe results aren’t dramatic in a “before and after photo” way. It’s subtle. My husband didn’t notice until I made him feel my cheek. “Oh,” he said. “Soft.” That was it. But I notice. I notice when I wake up and my face doesn’t feel tight. I notice when I wash my hands and they don’t immediately feel like parchment. I notice that I’m not constantly thinking about my skin or reaching for lip balm every five minutes.\n\nIt’s the absence of problems. That’s the win. My elbows haven’t been this smooth since… I don’t know when. High school? I put it on my heels sometimes. Works there too. It’s just a reliable, simple fix. I’m on my second jar now. I even got one for my mom. She has psoriasis on her hands. She was horrified at first. “Beef fat? On my skin?” But she tried it. Called me last week. “My hands aren’t itching,” she said. That’s huge for her.\n\nI’m not saying it’s a miracle. But for winter skin? For skin that’s just being difficult? It’s the best thing I’ve found. And I’ve tried a lot of expensive stuff in shiny packaging. This stuff in a simple jar beats them all. It just does.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, it is. It sounds bizarre, I know. But the science-ish reason is that it’s really similar to the oils our own skin makes. So it absorbs properly and helps your skin barrier do its job. It’s not just sitting on top clogging things up. It’s more like giving your skin a tool it already knows how to use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m prone to clogged pores. It absorbs so fast. It’s not a greasy layer. It’s more like it melts in and disappears. If you use a tiny amount, it’s gone. My skin actually got less congested because it wasn’t freaking out and overproducing oil to compensate for being dry.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like pineapple, but not like a cheap candle. It’s sweet and fruity, but not fake. It’s cheerful. Like a reminder of summer. The smell doesn’t stick around on your skin, which I prefer. It’s just a nice little moment when you’re putting it on.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my weird winter skin thing. A jar of whipped beef tallow that smells like pineapple. I didn’t expect to like it. But I do. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. If your skin is being difficult with the cold, might be worth a shot. It’s just a simple thing that works. I don’t know what else to say. I’m probably gonna order another one soon.",
