  "title": "My Honest Take on This Pear Tallow Balm (Yeah, Beef Fat)",
  "body": "So I bought beef fat for my face. I know. It sounds like something you’d do on a dare, or maybe after reading too many weird blogs at 2 AM. Which, okay, maybe that’s how it started. My hands were a disaster. Winter hit and they just… gave up. Cracked, red, the whole thing. Looked like I’d been fist-fighting sandpaper. I’d tried the usual stuff—the thick creams in the tub, the fancy lotions that smell like a spa. Nothing stuck. My skin drank it and asked for more, still felt tight and angry.\n\nThen I saw this thing online. Whipped tallow balm. Pear scent. Made in France. I stared at it for like a week. Beef tallow skincare. The words just don’t go together in your brain, you know? It feels wrong. But I was desperate, and my credit card was just sitting there, and it was a Tuesday night. So I clicked it.\n\nIt arrived in this little jar. Cute packaging, honestly. I opened it up and just… sniffed it. Braced for, I don’t know, a barnyard smell? Raw meat? Something gross. But it didn’t smell like that at all. It was sweet. But not candy sweet. Like a real pear, the kind that’s maybe a day from being too soft, with something green underneath. Gentle. I poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter that’s been whipped with a cloud. So I put a tiny bit on the back of my hand. Rubbed it in. It was thick, but then it just sort of vanished. No greasy film. My skin just ate it. Huh.\n\n## Why Putting Beef Fat on Your Skin Isn't Actually Crazy\n\nOkay, stay with me. I had to look this up because my brain kept going *but why though*. So, tallow is basically rendered beef fat. Sounds appetizing, right? But historically, like, forever-ago historically, people used animal fats for their skin. Your great-great-grandma probably had a jar of something similar on her shelf. It’s old-school wisdom. The science-y bit, which I read while half-watching a baking show, is that grass-fed beef tallow is structurally really close to the oils our own skin makes. That sebum stuff. So when you put it on, your skin recognizes it. It absorbs deep instead of just sitting on top playing dress-up. It’s like giving your skin something it already knows how to use. All those natural ingredients working with your skin, not against it.\n\nIt’s not just for your face, either. The listing said good for rough hands, psoriasis, chapped lips. My lips were perpetually chapped. I’d been using that medicated stuff in the tube forever. So that night, after the hand test, I put a tiny dab on my lips. It felt… different. Not tingly. Just soft. I woke up and they weren’t stuck together. That hadn’t happened in months. Weird.\n\nThe weather has been absolutely brutal lately, by the way. Just dry and cold and mean. My heater runs all day and my skin was basically screaming. I was using this tallow balm just on my hands and lips at first, kinda cautiously. But then I ran out of my night cream. It was one of those expensive ones in the fancy glass jar. And I just thought, you know what, let’s see what happens. Full send. So I started using the tallow balm on my face. I was skeptical. I have this weird combo skin that can get oily but also flaky. It’s a whole thing. I was sure I’d wake up with a face full of new friends. Zits. I mean zits.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does (Or, Didn't Do)\n\nI didn’t. Wake up with zits, I mean. My face felt… calm. That’s the only word for it. Not shiny. Not tight. Just calm. Like it had finally had a drink of water after being in the desert. I kept using it. Morning and night. Just a little scoop, warm it between my fingers, press it in. The pear scent is so light it’s basically gone once it’s on. It’s not a perfume. It’s just a nice little moment when you open the jar.\n\nHere’s the thing about tallow skincare benefits—it doesn’t feel like it’s *doing* anything dramatic in the moment. There’s no cooling sensation, no tingle, no immediate glow. It’s boring. It just… works. My foundation stopped clinging to dry patches. That red, irritated spot by my nose from blowing it all winter? Gone in like three days. My elbows, which are always rough, felt smooth. Not “soft to the touch” smooth, but just normal. Like they forgot to be angry at me.\n\nI got distracted earlier thinking about the hotel soap thing. You know how hotel soap is either amazing or terrible, no in-between? This is like the amazing one, but for your face. But it’s beef fat. I still can’t get over that. I told my sister about it and she just stared at me. “You put what on your face?” But then she tried it on her knuckles, which were cracked and bleeding, and she texted me two days later asking for the link. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it. Feels like someone’s just whipping it up in their kitchen, but in a good way. In a “I care about what’s in this” way.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been maybe a month now. I’m halfway through the jar. I ordered a second one already because I’m paranoid about running out. That’s the real review, right? When you re-buy before you’re done. My winter skin routine is now stupid simple. Wash face, tallow balm. Done. Sometimes I’ll add a drop of face oil if I’m feeling fancy, but I don’t need to. My hands don’t hurt. My face doesn’t feel like it’s going to crack when I smile. It’s just… settled.\n\nI was using this $80 cream before. Came in a heavy jar. Smelled like roses. It was fine. But this stuff, this grass-fed beef tallow whipped into a balm, it works better. And it’s one ingredient. Well, plus the pear scent stuff. But you know what I mean. It’s simple. It feels honest. There’s no list of chemicals you need a PhD to pronounce. It’s just fat. Good fat. From cows that ate grass. I sound like a weird hippie but I don’t care. It works.\n\nWould I buy it again? I already did. I’m looking at the new jar right now. It’s sitting next to my coffee mug. My skin is happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted, really. To not think about my skin all the time. To not be applying cream every five minutes. This just sort of… fixes it and then gets out of the way.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, honestly. It sounds nuts but it makes sense once you get past the idea. It’s super similar to the oil our skin makes naturally, so it absorbs really well and doesn’t just sit there clogging stuff up. It’s like giving your skin back what the winter (or stress, or whatever) stole.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nFor me, no. And I was sure it would. Because it’s an oil, right? But it’s a dry oil. It sinks in. My skin just drinks it up and feels balanced, not greasy. If you’re super, super oily you might use less, but it hasn’t caused any issues for me at all.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s nice. It’s not a fake, sugary pear candy smell. It’s more like the smell of a ripe pear when you first bite into it—fresh, a little sweet, a little green. It’s light, too. Fades pretty much once you rub it in so you’re not walking around smelling like fruit salad.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, or dry, or just generally pissed off at the world, this might be worth a shot. It’s weird, but the good kind of weird. The kind that works. I don’t know what else to say. My hands aren’t cracked anymore. That’s enough for me.",
