  "body": "Okay so it’s like 9 PM and I’m just sitting here after washing my face. My hands are still a little damp. I grab this little jar of the pear tallow balm, the whipped one. My routine is a mess, honestly. Sometimes I do the whole thing, sometimes I just splash water and slap this on. Tonight’s a slap-it-on night. It’s winter, my radiator is making that clicking noise it does, and the air in here feels like it’s sucking the moisture right out of my cheeks. Tallow balm. Beef fat. I know, it sounds like something you’d use to season a cast iron pan, not your face. I was super skeptical. My friend wouldn’t shut up about her tallow skincare routine, so I finally caved and got this pear-scented one from some Etsy shop. Opened it, smelled it… and just stared at it for a week. But my knuckles were starting to crack from the cold, like actually split, and my usual stuff wasn’t cutting it. So I tried it. And now it’s just… there. On my nightstand. I use it.\n\n## How This Beef Tallow Thing Ended Up On My Face\n\nLet me back up. It was a Tuesday, I think. Or a Wednesday. One of those days where you’re just done. I was scrolling, my phone was at 12%, and an ad for this whipped tallow balm popped up. Pear scent. Looked nice. I clicked because I was bored. The description said it was made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped in France, and that it mimics human skin oil so it sinks in deep. I remember thinking, “Human skin oil? That’s gross. But also… makes sense?” My brain was tired. I ordered it. Forgot about it. Then it showed up in this cute little jar. The whole thing felt very… quaint. Not clinical. Like someone made it in their kitchen. Which was either comforting or alarming, I couldn’t decide.\n\nAnyway, my coffee is getting cold. The point is, I started slow. I didn’t slather it everywhere. I’d just put a tiny dab, like half the size of a pea, on my pointer finger. Rub my fingers together to warm it up. Then pat it on the super dry spots. My cheeks first. Then my knuckles. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It’s solid but soft, like cold butter, but then it melts the second it touches your skin. It doesn’t sit on top. It just goes. Vanishes. That was the first thing that got me. No greasy film. My hands didn’t feel slippery. I could pick up my phone immediately. Big deal for a hand cream.\n\n## What My Daily Skincare With Tallow Actually Looks Like\n\nMy routine is not aesthetic. Don’t picture some Instagram shelfie. Picture a tired person at a sink.\nMorning: Sometimes I use it, sometimes I don’t. If I wake up and my face feels tight, like it’s shrink-wrapped, I’ll wet my hands, pat my face, and then take a smaller dab than at night. Just enough. Focus on the dry patches. It’s not a moisturizer I use under makeup—I don’t wear makeup—but it’s perfect before I have to go out into that windy, mean winter air. Creates this barrier. My face doesn’t get that raw, chapped feeling on the walk to the car.\n\nNight is the main event. This is my how to use tallow balm ritual, I guess. After I wash my face, while my skin’s still a bit damp. I unscrew the jar. The smell is… pear? But not like a Jolly Rancher. Not super sweet. It’s light. Fresh. It smells clean, like a just-cut pear maybe, but softer. Gentle. I don’t know how to describe it better than that. I scoop a bit out with my fingernail. Maybe a pea-sized amount for my whole face and neck. Rub between my palms. It melts instantly from the heat. Then I just press it all over. Pat, pat, pat. It’s kind of soothing. The whole process takes 45 seconds. Then I’m done. I go watch TV. My skin just feels… quiet. Not screaming for moisture. Hydrated. Not shiny. Just normal.\n\nI also keep it by the couch. For my hands. Because winter is brutal and I wash my hands a lot. The skin around my thumbs was a disaster. Now, when I’m watching something, I’ll just grab the jar and rub some into my cuticles and over the backs of my hands. The cracks are gone. Gone! I got one for my mom too because her hands get so bad. She texted me “what is this magic butter” which, coming from her, is a five-star review.\n\n## Why It Just Works (When I Thought It Wouldn't)\n\nI’ve tried a lot of stuff. Expensive creams in fancy jars. Drugstore lotions that come in pumps. Some worked okay. Most just sat on top of my skin, felt greasy, and my skin would still be flaky underneath. It was annoying. This tallow balm routine is different because it doesn’t feel like you’re adding a layer. It feels like you’re giving your skin what it’s missing. The whole “mimics sebum” thing—I looked it up after—actually tracks. Our skin knows what to do with it. It absorbs. Really absorbs. My skin just drinks it up.\n\nThe pear scent is nice. It’s not overpowering. It’s just… there. A faint, clean, fruity thing that disappears fast. It doesn’t clash with anything. It’s just pleasant. Sophisticated? Maybe. It doesn’t smell like beef. At all. That was my biggest fear. It smells like a nice, light skincare product. That’s it.\n\nBut get this—the best result, the one I didn’t expect, is my lips. I get chapped lips so easily. I’ve used every lip balm known to man. They work for ten minutes. I started putting a tiny, tiny bit of this tallow balm on my lips at night. Just a smear. Woke up with lips that felt… normal. Soft. Not peeling. Not needing immediate balm. That alone was worth the price. I’m on my second jar now. I just reordered last week. The Etsy shop I got it from is called “PearAndTallow” or something like that. Nice people. Packaged it cute.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. It sounds wild, but it makes sense when you think about it. Our skin produces its own oils (sebum) to protect and moisturize itself. Grass-fed tallow is really similar to that. So your skin recognizes it and knows how to use it properly. It’s not some weird alien chemical. It’s just… compatible fat. My face seems to think so, anyway.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And my skin can get clogged pretty easy. Because it absorbs so deeply and doesn’t just sit on the surface, I haven’t had any issues. It’s not pore-clogging. It’s more like… pore-feeding? That sounds weird. But it’s clean. Sinks right in.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light. Fresh. Like the idea of a pear, not a candy pear. It’s not super sweet or fake. It’s a gentle, clean, fruity scent that fades quickly after you put it on. It’s nice. Not overpowering at all.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my thing now. This little jar of whipped beef fat with a hint of pear. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. I don’t have to think about it. It just works. If your skin’s being difficult this winter, or you’re just curious about this whole tallow skincare thing, might be worth a shot. It was for me.",
