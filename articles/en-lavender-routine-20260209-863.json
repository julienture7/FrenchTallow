  "title": "My Lavender Tallow Balm Routine: It's Just Weird Enough to Work",
  "body": "Okay so I’m sitting here, it’s like 10:23 PM, and I just smeared beef fat on my face. Let that sink in. My hands still smell a little like dinner and also a field? I don’t know. It’s this lavender tallow balm I got on a whim from some Etsy shop in France. Looked weird. Sounded weirder. But my skin was doing that tight, flaky winter thing where it feels like paper, you know? And my usual stuff, that fancy cream in the blue jar that cost more than my electric bill, was just sitting there. Doing nothing. So I figured, why not. Beef tallow skincare. Let’s go.\n\nI was mid-routine when it clicked. Had just washed my face with that cheap Cetaphil bar. The air in my bathroom was dry, the kind of dry that makes you hear your own skin crackle. I was staring at my sad, red knuckles. Again. And I just grabbed the little jar of whipped tallow balm. The lavender one. Unscrewed it. It doesn’t look like much. Just off-white, kinda fluffy. Like butter you forgot on the counter.\n\n## How This Beef Tallow Thing Ended Up on My Face\n\nThe whole idea is bizarre. I know. Putting rendered cow fat from grass-fed cows, or whatever, on your face. It sounds like something your great-grandmother would have done before they invented, you know, science. But then I read this thing about how tallow is similar to the oils our skin already makes. Sebum. Mimics it. So it sinks in deep instead of just greasing you up. Made a weird kind of sense. My skin was clearly not into the modern chemical cocktails anymore.\n\nSo my routine now. It’s stupid simple. Nighttime only. I can’t do the whole ten-step thing. My brain checks out after step two.\n\nHere’s the drill: Clean face. Still damp, not dry. I scoop out a blob about the size of a pea. Maybe a little bigger for my Sahara-desert cheeks. Rub it between my palms. It melts fast. Then I just… pat and press it all over. Forehead, cheeks, the weird area around my nose that’s always angry. Neck too. Sometimes I just stare at the jar while I do it. The cat does too. He’s obsessed with it. Probably thinks it’s a new kind of butter.\n\nThe smell is… lavender. But not the sharp, cleaning-product lavender. It’s softer. More like the plant itself, crushed. Herbal. Timeless, I guess. It’s calming. Actually calming. Not in a fake “aromatherapy” way. I put it on and my brain goes, “Oh. Bedtime.” It’s become this signal. This tallow balm routine is basically my off-switch.\n\n## What Actually Happens When You Use Tallow\n\nThe first time, I braced for grease city. Woke up expecting a slick pillowcase. But nope. Skin just felt… quiet. Not tight. Not oily. Just there. Normal. Weird.\n\nMy daily skincare with tallow is just that one step at night. But the effects stick around. My hands were the real test. I wash them a million times a day. They get these cracks along the knuckles in winter. Like little paper cuts. Hurt like hell. So one night, after my face, I just globbed what was left on my hands. Went to bed. Woke up and the cracks were… less? Not gone, but softer. Less angry. After a few nights, they were basically healed. I didn’t even use that much. Just the leftovers.\n\nIt’s good for eczema, they say. I don’t have that, but I get these dry, itchy patches on my elbows. Like lizard skin. I started hitting them with the balm too. They’re smooth now. Actually smooth. I keep poking my elbow like an idiot because I can’t believe it.\n\nChapped lips? Yeah. Works. Better than that waxy tube stuff. I just use a tiny, tiny bit. Absorbs. Doesn’t taste like anything, which is a plus.\n\nI got sidetracked. The cat knocked over a pen. He’s an agent of chaos. Anyway, the balm. Right.\n\nThe texture is the surprising part. It’s whipped beef tallow balm, so you think it’ll be dense. But it’s light. Airy. Spreads easy. Doesn’t feel heavy. It just disappears into your skin after a few minutes. Leaves it sort of matte, but soft. Not shiny. You can’t even tell you’re wearing it. Except for the smell. Which is nice.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Experiment\n\nSo it’s been maybe a month? Maybe six weeks. I lost track. Time is fake.\n\nBut my skin is… chill. It’s not a miracle. I didn’t turn into a dewy newborn. But the constant winter tightness is gone. The flakiness around my nose is gone. My face just feels balanced. Like it’s not fighting me anymore. When I wake up, it doesn’t feel desperate for moisture. It just feels like skin.\n\nI’m on my second jar now. Ordered it before the first one was even empty. That’s the real review, right? Not just using it, but buying it again. With my own money. I even got one for my mom. She has rough hands from gardening. She called me last week and was like, “What is this magic fat?” She’s hooked too.\n\nI mentioned the Etsy shop to a friend. Just casually. Like “hey I found this weird thing.” She tried it. Now she texts me about it. We’ve become beef tallow people. It’s a whole thing.\n\nIt’s not glamorous. The jar is simple. The concept is medieval. But it works. It just does. My routine is five minutes now. Wash, tallow, done. I spend more time picking a podcast to fall asleep to.\n\n## Would I Buy This Lavender Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. Obviously. I already did.\n\nLook, if you’re curious about how to use tallow balm, just start simple. Don’t overthink it. It’s not a science project. It’s just a moisturizer that happens to come from a cow. A scoop at night. That’s it. See what happens.\n\nIt’s one of the few things I’ve bought online that actually did what it said it would. No hype. Just… works. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. The cat is confused but entertained. It’s a win.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s similar to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just sit on top. It feels like it’s fixing the barrier, not just covering up the problem.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores easy. It absorbs deep, so it doesn’t leave a pore-clogging film. My skin actually feels clearer since using it. Less irritated.\n\n**What does the lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nReal lavender. Like the plant. Herbal and clean, not sweet or perfumey. It’s relaxing. Makes the whole routine feel like a wind-down ritual, not a chore.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult with the dry air, might be worth a shot. It’s just a little jar of whipped fat. But it’s my little jar of whipped fat now. I don’t know what else to say. It works.",
