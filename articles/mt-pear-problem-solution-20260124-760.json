  "title": "My Hands Were a Disaster Until I Tried This Pear Tallow Balm",
  "body": "Okay so my hands. They were just wrecked. Like, cracking and bleeding wrecked. This was back in, I don’t know, early December maybe. I was sitting there on my couch, it was dark at like 5 PM, and I looked down and my knuckles were these red, angry lines. It hurt to make a fist. It hurt to wash dishes. It was all just very beige, the whole situation. I’d tried everything. The big tub of O’Keeffe’s Working Hands. That Neutrogena Norwegian Formula stuff that feels like glue. Some fancy Aesop cream my sister gave me for Christmas that smelled like a forest and cost more than my electric bill. Nothing stuck. My skin would drink it up and be dry again in an hour. I was about to just start wearing gloves to bed like some kind of weirdo. And then I saw someone online talking about beef tallow balm. For your face. I was skeptical. Obviously. Putting beef fat on your skin sounded like something my great-grandmother would have done, or like a weird TikTok trend. But this person mentioned a specific one, a whipped tallow balm from some little shop, and it came in a scent called Pear. I was desperate. And curious. So I ordered it.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Even Became a Thing I Considered\n\nLook. I get it. It sounds gross. Tallow. It’s beef fat. You cook with it. Or you used to, before everything came in a bottle. The whole idea felt very pioneer-core, like I should be churning butter next. But then I fell down a rabbit hole one night when I couldn’t sleep. My phone said it was 2:13 AM. The neighbor’s dog was barking. Anyway, I read that tallow from grass-fed cows is weirdly similar to the oils our own skin makes. Like, the structure of it is close to human sebum. So instead of just sitting on top of your skin like a plastic wrap, it actually gets in there. Your skin recognizes it. It’s like giving your skin a food it already knows how to eat. This particular balm is whipped, which I guess just makes it fluffy and easier to spread, and it’s made in France, which for some reason made me trust it more. Probably shouldn’t, but it did. I was wearing my rattiest sweatpants when I read all this, the ones with the hole near the pocket. The whole thing felt absurd. But my hands hurt. So I clicked buy.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nThe jar showed up a while later. It was small. Cute, honestly. I opened it right there in my kitchen, under the weird fluorescent light. The texture was… not what I expected. It wasn’t greasy. It was thick but soft, like if cold butter and whipped cream had a baby. You scoop a tiny bit and it melts the second it hits your skin warmth. I put some on the back of my hand. It vanished. Like, it was just gone. My skin looked sort of… calm? Not shiny. Not sticky. Just normal, but softer. I brought the jar up to my face. Smelled like. I don’t know. Nice though. Not a fake, sugary pear candy smell. More like if you walked past a pear tree on a cold day. A fresh smell. Light. It’s subtle, I guess is the word everyone uses, but for real this time. It’s just a gentle, clean, fruity smell that doesn’t punch you in the face. I remember thinking, “Huh. Okay.” Then my cat jumped on the counter and I had to shoo him away. That was that.\n\nI started using it that night. Just on my hands. A tiny scoop, rubbed it in. It felt cool for a second, then it was just gone. My hands didn’t feel like I’d put anything on them, which was the weirdest part. All the other creams left a film, a feeling. This left nothing. Just skin that didn’t feel like it was screaming. I went to bed. Woke up. My hands weren’t healed, obviously, but the cracks looked less angry. Less red. I kept doing it. Morning and night. After a few days, I got brave and put a little on my cheeks because the winter wind had been brutal. Same thing. Absorbed. No breakout. No weird pore-clogging feeling. I got mine from this Etsy shop called Satureja, just a small operation, and I liked that. Felt less corporate.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Weird Beef Fat\n\nSo here’s the thing. I didn’t have a dramatic, life-changing moment. It was slow. Quiet. After a week, I realized I hadn’t thought about my hands hurting all day. The cracks on my knuckles were closing up. They were just… normal hands. My face felt more resilient. I’d go outside and the wind wouldn’t make it feel tight and raw immediately. I started using it on my elbows, which have always been rough, like sandpaper. They’re smooth now. I don’t know when that happened. I just noticed it one day while I was leaning on my desk at work, waiting for a file to download. I looked at my elbow and thought, “Hey. That’s new.”\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s not going to turn back time or whatever. But for dry skin, for that winter-deep kind of dehydration, for sensitive skin that freaks out at everything… it just works. It’s a simple product. Whipped beef tallow, some pear oil for scent. That’s it. No list of unpronounceable ingredients. No water, so no need for preservatives. It’s just a balm. A really, really effective one. I’ve used it on my lips too when they’re chapped, and it’s better than any waxy lip balm I’ve tried. It actually fixes the problem instead of masking it. I’m on my second jar now. The first one lasted forever because you need so little.\n\nOh, random tangent—this reminds me of the hotel soap from that place in Denver I stayed at for a wedding. It was in a pear-shaped bottle and smelled amazing. I stole like three of them. This balm smells nothing like that soap, which was probably all synthetic, but for some reason my brain connects them. Memory is weird. Anyway.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did. I’m looking at the jar right now, it’s sitting next to my monitor. It’s half full. I’ll probably order another one soon so I don’t run out. I even got one for my mom, who has super sensitive skin and can’t use most lotions. She called me last week to say her wrists aren’t itchy anymore. That’s a big deal for her.\n\nI sound like an ad. I’m not. I just found something that actually does the thing it says it will do, which is so rare now. Everything is a miracle cure that does nothing. This is beef fat in a jar. It’s humble. It works. My skin is happy. I’m happy. That’s the whole story.\n\nIf your skin is being difficult, if you’ve tried the big brands and the pharmacy staples and they just don’t cut it, this might be worth a shot. The pear scent is lovely, really light and fresh. It just feels like good, simple, natural skincare. No drama.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs deeply and doesn’t just sit on top clogging things up. It’s like giving your skin something it actually knows how to use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t. It absorbs fully. It’s not a greasy layer. My fussy skin hasn’t had a single issue with it.\n\n**What does the Pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a gentle, fresh pear scent. Not candy-like. Not overpowering. Just a clean, light, fruity smell that fades pretty quickly after you put it on. It’s nice. Subtle in the good way.",
