  "title": "Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm: I Put Beef Fat On My Face So You Don't Have To Wonder",
  "body": "Okay so. I put beef fat on my face. I know. It sounds like something you’d do on a dare in a college dorm, not a skincare step. My phone was at like 12% when I first saw the ad for this whipped tallow balm stuff. Bourbon Vanilla scent. I was scrolling, half-watching some cooking show, and I just stopped. Beef tallow? For skin? I think I actually said “huh” out loud to my empty living room. The cat looked at me. But my skin was doing that weird winter thing where it’s both tight and flaky, like a stale croissant, and the fancy lotion from the mall wasn’t cutting it. It was just sitting there, all expensive and useless. So I got curious. Skeptical, but curious. What’s the worst that could happen? I smell like a kitchen? I ordered the small jar of this bourbon vanilla tallow balm from some little Etsy shop, mostly as a joke for myself. A weird little experiment.\n\nIt showed up on a Tuesday, I think. Or maybe Wednesday. The weather had been this gross cold rain for days. The jar was smaller than I pictured. Simple. I opened it.\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face (And Why I Didn't Run Screaming)\n\nFirst impression was the smell. Not beefy. At all. Which was shock number one. It smelled like… vanilla. But not like candle vanilla or ice cream vanilla. Deeper. Warmer. Like if you baked vanilla beans into something and then left it in a cupboard with an old leather book. Bourbon vanilla, they call it. It’s cozy. It’s the smell of a blanket fort when you’re a kid. I just sat there sniffing it for a minute. My brain was trying to connect this nice smell with the words “grass-fed beef tallow” on the label and failing completely.\n\nThe texture was the next weird part. It’s whipped, so it’s this super light, almost fluffy paste. You scoop a tiny bit and it just… melts. The second it touches your skin, it turns into this silky oil. I mean, I guess it’s silky. It’s not greasy. It just disappears. I put some on the back of my hand first, like a test patch, waiting for it to be a gross sticky mess. It wasn’t. It was gone. And my skin just looked like skin, but calmer. Not shiny. Not sticky. Just… normal. But softer.\n\nSo I got brave. I washed my face that night, patted it dry, and just went for it. A tiny dab, rubbed between my palms, and pressed it into my face. My brain was still going “BEEF FAT BEEF FAT” but my skin was just like “ahhhhh.” It felt like nothing. And also like everything. Wait, that makes no sense. It felt like my skin could finally breathe, but also like it had a drink of water after being in the desert. I don’t know. It’s hard to describe. You just have to feel it.\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense (No, Really)\n\nSo after the initial “hey this isn’t gross” phase, I got nosy. Why would this even work? I fell down a internet rabbit hole instead of going to sleep. Here’s the thing—and I’m gonna try to say this without sounding like a textbook, because I am not a textbook, I’m a person who googles things at 1 AM—our skin produces oil, right? Sebum. That’s the stuff that can make you shiny or clog pores if there’s too much. Well, the fat from grass-fed cows, the tallow, is apparently really similar to that stuff. Like, structurally similar. So when you put it on, your skin kinda recognizes it. It’s not some alien, lab-made chemical it has to figure out. It’s like giving your skin back something it already understands how to use.\n\nThat’s the science-y bit I vaguely grasped. The grandma wisdom bit is easier. People have been using animal fats on their skin forever. Lard, tallow, all of it. For chapped hands, for windburn, for babies with diaper rash. My own grandma used to swear by bag balm on everything, which is lanolin from sheep. This is just the beef version. It’s not a new, revolutionary, cutting-edge concept. It’s an old, simple, kinda obvious one. We just forgot about it because shiny plastic bottles with French words are more appealing than a jar of fat. I get it. I was there.\n\nBut the old way works. The tallow balm sinks in deep because it’s so similar to our own skin stuff. It doesn’t just sit on top like a film, which is what my old lotion was doing. It actually goes in there. Which is why it’s supposed to be good for things like eczema or just brutal winter damage. It’s like deep, deep moisture from the inside out. I read that and I was like, huh. Maybe my great-great-grandma was onto something. And she probably didn’t get hers in a cute jar with bourbon vanilla scent, so I’ve got it good.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Weirdness\n\nSo I kept using it. Morning and night. Just that one little jar of bourbon vanilla tallow balm. The first thing I noticed wasn’t even on my face. My hands. I’m terrible about hand cream. Always have been. But I’d have leftover balm on my palms after doing my face, so I’d just rub it into the back of my hands. The little cracks I get by my knuckles in winter? Gone in like four days. Just… healed. That was the moment I was like, oh. This isn’t a gimmick.\n\nMy face took a little longer to show off, maybe a week and a half. The tight, dry feeling I’d wake up with was just… not there. My foundation, on the rare days I bother, doesn’t look all flaky and cakey anymore. It just sits on my skin like it’s supposed to. The best way I can describe it is that my skin just looks quiet. Not angry, not stressed, not parched. Just content. It has this… healthy look. Not a glow, that sounds too fancy. It just looks like good skin. Like I drank enough water and got a full eight hours, which I absolutely did not.\n\nI got distracted thinking about how my skin hasn’t looked this normal since before I had to start paying a mortgage. Stress does a number on you. Anyway. The point is, it works. The tallow skincare benefits are real, at least for my desert-croissant winter skin. It’s the only thing I’ve used for weeks. I even used it on my lips when I couldn’t find my chapstick. Worked better.\n\n## Would I Buy This Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm Again?\n\nI’m on my second jar already. I ordered it before the first one even ran out because I got paranoid. That’s my review, I guess. I didn’t wait to see if I’d miss it. I knew I would.\n\nI told my sister about it. She was horrified at first. Then curious. Then she stole a little scoop of mine in a contact lens case. Now she has her own jar. She said it fixed the dry patch on her elbow that nothing else would touch. So it’s not just me.\n\nIf you’re curious, I got mine from this Etsy shop that just makes this stuff. It’s not a big company. It feels like someone just making batches in their kitchen, which I kind of love. Knowing it’s just whipped beef tallow balm made from grass-fed beef suet and some natural ingredients for scent, that’s it. No mystery list of unpronounceable things. It’s weirdly comforting.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, honestly. It sounds bonkers, but it makes sense once you read about it. Since it’s so close to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well and doesn’t just clog stuff up. It’s like giving your skin food it actually knows how to digest.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores if I look at a moisturizer wrong. Because it melts and sinks in so deep, it doesn’t sit there on top of your skin blocking pores. It’s the opposite. It seems to help my skin balance itself out.\n\n**What does the Bourbon Vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s vanilla, but not sweet. It’s warm and deep and cozy. Like the vanilla extract in your grandma’s cupboard, mixed with a little bit of a cozy, almost smoky feel. It’s not a perfume-y smell. It fades pretty quick after you put it on, you’re mostly just left with soft skin.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow story. I put beef fat on my face and now my skin is happy. I don’t have a more elegant way to put it. If your skin’s being difficult and the usual stuff isn’t cutting it, maybe give it a shot. Worst case, you have a funny story. Best case, you have really calm, quiet skin. And who doesn’t want that?",
