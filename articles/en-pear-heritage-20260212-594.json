  "title": "That Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear: My Weird Winter Skin Fix",
  "body": "Okay so. I was scrolling on my phone, it was like 11:47pm, and my face felt like it was made of old parchment. You know that winter feeling. Everything’s tight. Itchy. My knuckles were starting to crack. I was looking at some fancy cream online that cost more than my electric bill and I just thought… no. There has to be something else. And then I fell into this internet hole. People were talking about putting beef fat on their face. Seriously. Tallow. Like the stuff from candles and cooking. My brain went straight to my grandma’s kitchen, not my bathroom shelf. But the comments were all like “it changed my skin” and “nothing else worked.” I was skeptical. Obviously. But also desperate. So I found this little Etsy shop, ordered their whipped tallow balm in pear, and figured at worst I’d have a weird story.\n\nIt showed up in this simple jar. I opened it. Texture was… thick. Like really thick. But you scoop a bit and it sort of melts? Not greasy. I don’t know how to describe it. Smelled like pear. Not candy pear. More like a real one, almost with a green stem smell. Or not. Something. I put it on my sandpaper hands first because I wasn’t brave enough for my face. And here’s the weird part: it just sank in. No film. My hands were just… normal. Not shiny. Not sticky. Just not cracked. Huh.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Got on My Face\n\nSo I had to look this up. Why is this a thing? Turns out, it’s not a new internet trend. It’s like, ancient. My grandma probably knew about it and never told me. People have been using animal fats on their skin for centuries. Lard, tallow, all that. It makes sense if you think about it before factories made everything in tubes. What else would you use? Before petroleum jelly was invented in the 1800s, what did people do for chapped lips? They used what they had. Tallow. It’s just rendered beef fat. From grass-fed cows, in this case. From France, apparently.\n\nThe science-y reason—and I read this on some blog, so take it with a grain of salt—is that it’s really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Sebum. So our skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a silicone blanket; it actually gets in there. It’s like giving your skin food it knows how to eat. All those expensive creams have a million ingredients trying to mimic this one simple thing. And I’m sitting here with a jar of whipped beef fat from an Etsy seller. Funny.\n\nAnyway my coffee is getting cold. The point is, I tried it on my face that night. I was watching some bad TV, my feet were cold, and I just went for it. Put a tiny bit on my cheeks and forehead. Braced for a breakout. For grease. For something.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nNothing happened. In a good way. My face didn’t feel suffocated. It just felt… quiet. Not thirsty. I woke up and my skin wasn’t screaming for moisture. It was just there. Being skin. That was week one.\n\nBy week two, I was using it every night. The jar lives on my nightstand next to a pile of books I’m not reading. My routine got stupid simple. Wash face. Put on tallow. Done. I’d use it on my elbows and knees in the morning too—those desert zones. The pear scent is light. It’s there when you open the jar but doesn’t hang around. It’s not perfume-y. It’s just a fresh, clean fruit thing. Not sweet. It’s sophisticated, I guess? But I feel weird saying that. It just smells nice.\n\nWinter really hit then. Wind that feels like sandpaper. Indoor heat sucking all the humidity out of the air. My old standby lotion wasn’t cutting it. It would feel okay for an hour then I’d be back to scratchy. But this tallow balm? It lasted. My hands stopped looking like a lizard’s. Seriously. No cracks. My face didn’t have that tight, stretched feeling by 3 PM. I started putting a dab on my lips before bed. Best lip balm I’ve ever used, and I’ve tried them all. It’s not glossy. It just fixes them.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI don’t want to sound like an infomercial. But I saw my mom and she said my skin looked “rested.” I hadn’t slept well in days, so it wasn’t that. It was just… calm. No red patches. No dry flakes around my nose. That one line on my forehead—my “what is even happening” line—looked less like a canyon. Just softer. It’s not a miracle. It’s not going to make you look 21 again. But it makes your skin look like healthy skin. Not struggling skin.\n\nI spent so much money over the years. Fancy acids. Peptides. Bottles with gold lettering. And they’d work for a bit, or irritate me, or just do nothing. This is just one ingredient. Well, two if you count the pear oil for scent. That’s it. It feels like a cheat code. Or maybe just going back to basics. A traditional tallow skincare thing that got lost because it wasn’t shiny and new in a box.\n\nOh, and I got one for my friend who has eczema on her hands. She texted me last week like “what is this wizardry.” She said it was the first thing that didn’t sting and actually helped. So there’s that.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nI’m on my second jar. So yeah.\n\nLook, it’s weird. Telling people you put beef tallow on your face is a conversation starter. Or ender. But I don’t care. It works. My skin is the best it’s been in years, and I’m doing less. There’s something deeply satisfying about that. It’s not a 12-step routine. It’s a one-ingredient solution. The whole natural skincare comeback thing—this feels like the real version of that. Not just marketing.\n\nIf you’re curious, the shop I got it from is on Etsy. Just search for the whipped tallow balm in pear. It’s not a big brand. It’s just someone making small batches. I like that.\n\nAnyway. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted. A simple fix for winter face. And I guess I found it in my grandma’s hypothetical pantry.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so close to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just coat your skin—it seems to help it balance itself out. My face stopped over-producing oil in some spots once it wasn’t so dry.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was terrified of this. But no, for me it didn’t. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. It sinks right in. If anything, my pores look smaller because my skin isn’t inflamed and dry.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nLike a real pear, not candy. Fresh and light. A tiny bit green, maybe? It’s not strong. The smell doesn’t stick around after you rub it in, which I like.\n\nSo yeah. If your skin is being difficult this winter, might be worth a shot. It’s just a simple thing that works.",
