  "title": "My Weird Pineapple Tallow Balm Experiment (It Worked)",
  "body": "Okay so I was on my phone late, like 11:47pm late, and my hands were a disaster. Winter does that. They looked like old paper bags. I was scrolling through Etsy for hand cream, anything, and I saw this thing called Whipped Tallow Balm. Pineapple scent. My brain went: beef fat? For your skin? With pineapple? That’s… a choice. But the pictures looked nice. And I was tired. And my knuckles hurt. So I clicked it. That’s how this whole tallow thing started for me. I didn't know I was buying into some ancient skincare comeback. I just wanted my hands to not crack open.\n\nAnyway it showed up a while later. Small jar. Felt solid. I opened it and poked it. Texture was weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter whipped with air? It smelled like pineapple. Not candy pineapple, not cleaning product pineapple. Like if a pineapple was subtle. Or maybe just fruity. I don’t know how to describe smells. It was cheerful. Made me think of a vacation I never took. I put a tiny bit on the back of my hand. Cold at first. Then it just… vanished. My skin drank it. No greasy film. No shiny residue. It was just gone and my skin felt different. In a good way. Soft, I guess. But not slippery soft. Weird.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Became My Thing\n\nSo after that first weird try, I went down a rabbit hole. Because putting beef fat on your face sounds insane in 2024. Right? But then I remembered my grandma. Not my Italian grandma with the olive oil, my other one. She had this little tin of something she’d put on her elbows. Always said it was “the good stuff.” Never said what it was. I called my mom. “Oh,” she says, “That was probably the mutton tallow from the farm. Everyone used it.” And it clicked. This wasn’t some new, fancy, cutting-edge lab creation. This was my grandma’s chapped-knuckle solution. She just called it “the good stuff” and moved on with her life.\n\nTurns out, people have been using animal fats on their skin for basically forever. Like, ancient Egypt forever. Romans. Medieval folks. It was the original moisturizer before “moisturizer” was even a word. They’d render down the fat from cows or sheep, and that was the lotion. Then the 20th century happened. We got obsessed with chemicals and factories and things in tubes. Tallow got labeled as old-fashioned. Gross, even. It became something you cooked with, not something you smoothed on your face. But the thing is, our skin’s natural oil—sebum—is really similar to tallow. Like, structurally similar. So when you put tallow on, your skin recognizes it. It’s not fighting a foreign silicone or mineral oil. It’s like, “Oh, hey, I know this guy. Come on in.” That’s the science, I think. Or the history. Both.\n\nSo this balm I got is basically that old idea, but fancy. It’s grass-fed beef tallow from France, whipped up so it’s fluffy. No weird extras. Just the fat, some essential oils for the pineapple smell, and that’s it. It mimics our skin’s sebum. That’s why it absorbs like it does. No sitting on top. It goes in. For my winter-wrecked hands, it was like a deep drink of water they didn’t know they needed.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nI started just on my hands. Because I wasn’t brave enough for my face yet. The jar sat by my bed. Every night before passing out, I’d scoop a little. The routine became: brush teeth, plug in phone, tallow hands. After maybe four days, I noticed. The cracks along my thumb were closing up. The sandpaper feeling was gone. My skin just felt… calm. Not repaired, exactly. More like it had forgotten to be angry at the cold, dry air. It was just existing peacefully. That was new.\n\nSo then I got bold. I put it on my face. I was doing my whole nighttime thing, looking in the mirror, thinking about the fine lines that weren’t there five years ago. The ones by my eyes. I thought, what’s the worst that could happen? A breakout? I’m in my 30s, a pimple is a nostalgic event at this point. So I took a tiny, tiny bit, warmed it between my fingers, and patted it on. Mostly around my eyes and on my forehead. It felt rich. Not heavy, but substantial. Like a good meal for your skin. Went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball.\n\nI didn’t. My skin in the morning was… quiet. Not shiny. Not red. Just plump. The lines looked less like canyons and more like faint pencil marks. I kept doing it. Not every night, but maybe three times a week. My fancy night cream from the department store, the one that cost more than my electric bill, sat untouched. This little jar of whipped beef fat was winning. The whole situation was very humbling. And a little funny. I’m using a skincare method my peasant ancestors would recognize, ordered off the internet, scented like a tropical fruit. The 21st century is bizarre.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been a bit now. I’m maybe halfway through the jar. I got it from this little Etsy shop, Mt. Heritage I think it’s called. They make it in small batches. Feels like you’re getting something from a person, not a factory. That’s nice.\n\nThe results are… they’re not magical. Let’s be clear. I didn’t turn into a dewy teenager. But my skin is just consistently better. It’s not a rollercoaster anymore. No random dry patches that makeup clings to. No tight feeling after I wash my face. The skin on my hands is normal. Not “good for winter” normal, just normal. My elbows, which are always forgotten, aren’t rough. They haven’t been this smooth since… I don’t know when. Maybe never.\n\nThe best part is the simplicity. My bathroom counter was a graveyard of half-used serums and potions. Acne stuff from my 20s I was still trying, brightening things, hydrating toners. A whole landscape of promises in bottles. Now? I wash my face. Sometimes I use this. That’s it. It’s one product that does the job of like, five. It’s a balm, so I’ve used it on cuticles, on a dry spot on my ankle, even on my lips once when my chapstick was lost. It just works. It’s the skincare version of a cast-iron skillet. Old, reliable, does one thing perfectly.\n\nWould I buy it again? I already did. I got one for my mom for Christmas. She called me confused. “Beef tallow?” she said. I told her, “Just try it. It’s Grandma’s ‘good stuff,’ but it smells like Hawaii.” She laughed. She’s using it now too.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, honestly. It sounds wild but it makes sense once you think about it. Our skin knows what to do with it because it’s so similar to our own oils. It doesn’t just sit there—it gets absorbed and helps your skin barrier do its job. My face has been happier since I started.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this too. But no, not for me. If anything, my skin feels more balanced. Because it’s getting the moisture it actually needs, it might produce less extra oil. The whipped version is light, it melts right in. Doesn’t feel pore-clogging at all.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s fruity. Sweet but not fake. Not like a piña colada or a candle. Just a clean, bright pineapple smell that fades pretty fast after you put it on. It’s cheerful. Makes the whole experience feel less like you’re rubbing animal fat on yourself and more like you’re treating yourself. Which, I guess you are.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow story. From a late-night “what is this” click to a jar I actually use. It’s not a miracle. It’s just a really, really good version of something people figured out a long time ago. Sometimes the old ways are the old ways for a reason. Anyway, if your skin is being difficult with this winter air, might be worth a shot. It just works. I don’t know what else to say.",
