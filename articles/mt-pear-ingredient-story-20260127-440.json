  "title": "Pear Tallow Balm: My Skin Got Weirdly Happy",
  "body": "Okay so I was scrolling Etsy at like 11 PM looking for a lip balm. My hands were cracking from winter, you know the deal. Everything’s dry. I saw this thing called a whipped tallow balm. Pear scent. I stopped scrolling. Beef fat? For your face? I was in my old hoodie, the one with the coffee stain, and I just stared at the screen. It sounded like something my great-grandma would have had in a tin. Not a fancy skincare thing. But the pictures looked… nice. And I was tired of spending $40 on creams that made my skin feel tight. So I clicked it. I figured, worst case, I’m out thirty bucks and I have a weird story. Anyway, here’s what happened.\n\n## How I Started Putting Beef Fat on My Face\n\nLook, I was skeptical. Very. The whole concept of grass-fed beef tallow skincare made me pause. I’m not a crunchy person. I buy regular soap. But the description talked about it being whipped and having this light pear smell, and something about it mimicking human skin oil. Sebum. That’s the word. I remember reading that and thinking, “Huh. That’s a thing.” So I ordered it. While I waited, I fell down a Google hole. Apparently, people have been using animal fats on their skin forever. Lard, tallow, all that. It’s not new. It’s actually very, very old. Grandma wisdom, you know? Before there was a whole aisle at Target for lotion. They just used what they had. And tallow is stable, it’s full of vitamins A, D, E, K… all that good stuff that’s already in our skin. My coffee was getting cold. I was reading about fatty acid profiles at 7 AM. This is where my life was at.\n\nThe jar showed up a week later. Small, glass, simple label. I opened it. Texture was… interesting. Not what I expected. It was whipped, like cool whip but denser. You scoop a little. It melts super fast from your fingers. I put some on the back of my hand. Cold at first, then it just vanished. No greasy film. My skin just drank it. It was soft after. Not “soft to the touch” like in an ad, just… normal. Like skin should feel. The smell was pear, but not candy pear. More like a real pear that’s almost ripe. Subtle. Gone in a minute. I was sitting at my kitchen table, in that morning light that shows every dry patch, and I just went for it. Slapped it on my face. Felt like a weirdo. But also, kind of brilliant.\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nSo the science-y bit, without being boring. Our skin makes oil called sebum. It’s a mix of fats. Tallow from grass-fed cows has a fatty acid profile that’s really, really close to ours. Closer than most plant oils. So when you put it on, your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a silicone blanket. It gets absorbed. It works with your skin, not against it. That’s why it’s supposed to be good for sensitive skin, or eczema, or psoriasis. It’s not introducing some strange chemical compound. It’s giving your skin building blocks it already knows how to use. I read that and it clicked. It’s not magic. It’s just… logical. Like using wood to fix a wooden chair.\n\nI used to use this expensive cream from one of those fancy brands in the white jar. It smelled like a hotel lobby. It felt nice going on but an hour later my cheeks would feel tight again. Like my skin was thirsty but the cream just put a lid on it. This tallow balm is different. It’s hydrating but in a deep way. My skin doesn’t feel “moisturized” in a glossy sense. It just feels… calm. Not angry. Not tight. Not flaky. Just there. Existing peacefully. Which, in January, is a minor miracle. My elbows haven’t been this smooth since I was a kid. I don’t know when that happened. I just noticed it one day.\n\nOh, and I got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it in small batches. In France, I think. It feels like someone actually made it, not a machine in a huge factory. That matters to me for some reason. Maybe because it’s such a simple thing. Just tallow, some pear oil for scent, that’s it. The ingredient list is shorter than my grocery receipt.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been maybe a month now. I use it at night, mostly. After I wash my face. Sometimes on my hands if they’re really bad. The results aren’t dramatic in a “whoa transformation” way. It’s more subtle. The little dry patch by my eyebrow that I’ve had for two years is just… gone. I didn’t even notice it leaving. My foundation doesn’t cling to weird flakes anymore. It just goes on. My hands don’t look like a lizard’s. That’s the big one. I work on a computer and wash my hands a lot and winter is brutal. This balm fixes the cracks overnight. Like, actually.\n\nI told my mom about it. She was horrified at first. “Beef fat? On your face?” But then she tried some on her knuckles, which are always rough. She called me two days later asking for the link. Now she uses it. That’s the real test, right? If your mom steals your skincare.\n\nIt’s not a miracle cure for everything. I still get a pimple sometimes. But it doesn’t make them worse. If anything, they heal faster. The whole thing is just… balanced. My skin feels balanced. Which is a word I never thought I’d use. It sounds like a yoga thing. But it’s true. It’s not oily. It’s not dry. It’s just skin. Weird, right? That this is the goal.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, I think so. It sounds bizarre but it makes sense when you read about it. It’s similar to the oils our skin makes naturally, so it absorbs well and doesn’t just clog stuff up. It’s been used forever. It’s like the original moisturizer.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m kinda prone to clogged pores. Because it’s so similar to our own sebum, it seems to absorb properly instead of sitting in the pore. It’s non-comedogenic, which is the fancy word for “won’t clog pores.” My skin actually feels clearer.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s nice. Light. Like a real pear, not a Jolly Rancher. It’s fresh and a little sweet but not overpowering. The smell doesn’t stick around long, which I like. It’s just a nice little moment when you put it on.\n\nSo yeah. I’m probably gonna order another jar soon. I’m almost out. If your skin is being difficult with the cold weather, or you’re just tired of complicated routines, this might be worth a shot. It’s simple. It works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
