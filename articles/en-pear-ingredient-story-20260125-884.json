  "title": "So I Put Beef Fat on My Face (The Pear Tallow Balm Experiment)",
  "body": "Okay look. Beef tallow balm. Sounds like something you’d find in a Civil War reenactor’s kit, right? That was my exact first thought. My skin was freaking out last month—this weird winter combo of dry, tight, but also somehow greasy in patches? It was a whole thing. I was scrolling, probably avoiding work, and saw this whipped tallow stuff. Grass-fed beef tallow. For your face. From some shop in France. I stared at my phone for a solid minute. My brain short-circuited. Putting rendered cow fat on my skin felt like a prank my ancestors would play on me. But I was desperate. And curious. So I clicked buy.\n\nThe jar showed up on a Tuesday. It was cold. I was wearing my ratty gray sweatpants and a hoodie that’s probably older than my car. I opened the box thinking, “This is gonna be a whole mess.” But the jar itself was… cute. Simple. I unscrewed it.\n\n**## How Beef Tallow for Skin Stopped Sounding Insane**\n\nFirst, the smell. The listing said “Pear.” I was expecting like, Jolly Rancher. It’s not that. It’s… I don’t know. Fresh? But not laundry fresh. Like if you walked past a pear tree and got a whiff of the air around it, not the fruit itself. It’s soft. Gentle. My cat, Frank, who ignores everything, actually came over and sniffed the jar. He gave it a slow blink, which is basically a five-star review from him.\n\nThe texture was the real surprise. I was picturing lard. Like, Crisco. This is not that. It’s whipped. It’s this fluffy, almost cloud-like balm that melts the second it touches your skin. You scoop a tiny bit—and I mean tiny, like half a pea—and it just vanishes. No greasy film. No sitting on top of your skin feeling like you’ve been basted. It just goes in.\n\nThis is where I had to do some googling. Because I needed to justify putting beef fat on my face to myself. The science-y bit, casually: our skin’s natural oil, sebum? It has a lot of similar fats to grass-fed beef tallow. Something about the fatty acid profile being close. So instead of just sitting there, it can actually sink in and tell your skin it’s okay to chill out. It’s like giving your skin something it already recognizes. My grandma would’ve called this “old wisdom” and then probably told me a story about using lard on her hands in the winter. She wasn’t wrong about a lot of things.\n\n**## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does (For Me, Anyway)**\n\nI started using it at night. After washing my face, while I was half-watching some true crime show. Just a little dab on my fingertips, press it into my cheeks, forehead, neck. The first thing I noticed was my skin didn’t feel thirsty an hour later. You know that feeling? Where you put on moisturizer and then your skin is like, “More. I need more.” This just… settled things down.\n\nA few days in, I got brave and used it on my elbows. My elbows are a disaster. Always have been. Like dry, sandpapery relics. I rubbed a bit in before bed. Woke up. Poked my elbow. It was… different. Not perfect. But softer. Less like it could start a fire if I rubbed it on something.\n\nThe real test was my face after a week. I have this one fine line—I won’t say where—that always looks worse when I’m dehydrated. It was just… less there. Not gone. I’m not selling magic in a jar. But it was plumped out, less noticeable. My whole face just looked calmer. More even. Not “glowing” in that weird Instagram way, but healthy. Like I’d actually slept.\n\nOh, and my lips. I forgot to mention. I get these cracks at the corners in winter. Painful. I put a microscopic amount of the tallow balm on them one night. Just a dab. It healed them up faster than any fancy lip treatment I’ve ever bought. That alone felt like a win.\n\n**## Would I Buy This Beef Tallow Skincare Thing Again?**\n\nHere’s the thing. I’ve spent… a lot. On creams in fancy jars with unpronounceable ingredients. Some worked okay. Most were just fine. This whipped tallow balm, this weird little jar from an Etsy shop in France, worked better. It’s simple. Grass-fed beef tallow, some pear oil for scent, that’s basically it. No list of fifty chemicals. It feels honest.\n\nI’m almost out of my first jar. I’m definitely ordering another. Maybe two, because my mom tried mine when she was over and now she wants one. She called it “that nice pear cream” and didn’t blink at the tallow part. Smart lady.\n\nIt’s not a miracle. But for winter skin, for that deep, thirsty dryness that nothing else seems to fix? It’s the best thing I’ve found. It makes sense in a way that all the complicated lab-made stuff suddenly doesn’t. My skin just… likes it. I don’t have a better explanation.\n\n**## Quick Questions I Get Asked**\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well instead of clogging things up. It’s like giving your skin nutrients it already knows how to use. My face seems to think so, anyway.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this too. But no, not for me. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. The key is it sinks in deep. It doesn’t just sit on top like a greasy layer, so it doesn’t trap anything underneath.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s hard to describe. It’s not a candy pear. It’s light and fresh, like the idea of a pear. Not sweet, just… clean and a little fruity. It’s subtle. Fades pretty quick after you put it on. Frank the cat approves, for what that’s worth.\n\nAnyway. If your skin’s being difficult this winter, and the usual stuff isn’t cutting it, this might be worth a weird shot. I got mine from that Etsy shop, Les Douces Choses. No one’s paying me to say this. I’m just a person whose elbows are finally presentable. And that’s something.",
