  "title": "Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm: I Tried Beef Fat on My Face So You Don't Have To Be Weirded Out",
  "body": "Okay so I bought this beef tallow balm. The bourbon vanilla one. I was just scrolling on my phone, my foot was asleep, and I saw an ad for it. Beef fat. For your skin. My first thought was, obviously, \"what the actual hell.\" Like, are we putting bacon grease on our cheeks now? But my skin last winter was a disaster. All red and tight and flaky, like a bad sunburn but from the dry air. I’d tried that fancy stuff in the blue jar that everyone talks about. Made my face feel like it was wrapped in plastic. So I was desperate. And curious. So I clicked.\n\nIt showed up in a little box. The jar itself is... fine. It’s a jar. I think my cat was more interested in the box. But I opened it. And I have to tell you about this bourbon vanilla tallow balm smell. It’s not like a candle. Or vanilla extract. It’s deeper. Warmer. Like if you walked into a kitchen where someone was baking something really good, but hours ago, and the smell just settled into the wood. Comforting. Not sweet. Just... good. Cozy. I don’t know how else to put it.\n\nAnyway, I stared at it. This creamy, off-white stuff. Whipped beef tallow balm. From grass-fed cows, apparently. Made in France. I poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Thick, but soft. Like cold butter that’s been sitting out for exactly twenty minutes. I was still skeptical. Putting beef fat on my face felt like a prank I was playing on myself.\n\n## How I Convinced Myself to Smear Cow Fat on My Face\n\nLook, I had to google it. I couldn’t just do it. My brain needed permission. So I fell down this rabbit hole at like, 11:30 PM. And the science-y stuff, casually explained, kind of made my head hurt but also made sense? Our skin makes oil. Sebum. It’s a mix of fats. Tallow from grass-fed beef is apparently really, really close to that mix. Closer than most plant oils or whatever’s in regular lotion. So the idea is your skin recognizes it. It’s like giving your skin something it already knows how to use, instead of some synthetic thing it has to figure out.\n\nThen I thought about my grandma. Not skincare, but she always saved bacon grease in a tin by the stove. Cooked everything in it. Said it was good for you. People have been using animal fats forever. For leather, for wounds, for skin. Lard soap. All that old-school wisdom we threw out for plastic bottles with unpronounceable ingredients. It started to feel less like a weird TikTok trend and more like... going back to something.\n\nSo I did it. I took the tiniest bit. Rubbed it between my fingers to warm it up. It melted. Like, instantly. Not greasy, just... oily in a way that disappeared. I put it on my cheeks and forehead, the driest parts. Braced for a breakout or a weird film.\n\nIt just... sank in. My skin drank it. It felt hungry. There was no residue. No shine. Just soft. Not \"soft to the touch\" like a brochure, just... normal. Like my skin but calmer. I was shocked. I kept touching my face. Waiting for the greasiness. It never came.\n\n## What This Stuff Actually Did For My Winter Skin\n\nThe real test was the next morning. I woke up and my face wasn’t tight. Usually, it feels like a mask has dried on it. That day, nothing. Just skin. I started using the tallow balm every night. Not a lot. A little scoop the size of a pea.\n\nHere’s where the grass-fed beef tallow benefits got real for me. I have these dry, red patches on my elbows. Always have. Like lizard skin. On a whim, I put the tallow on them. Two days later, they were smoother. Not perfect, but the angry red was gone. Just... gone. My knuckles, which crack and bleed every winter, just stopped. I didn’t even realize it until I was doing the dishes and my hands didn’t sting.\n\nThe bourbon vanilla scent became this whole thing. Putting it on became the last thing I did before bed. That warm, cozy smell. It’s not perfume-y. It doesn’t linger on your skin. It’s just there while you’re applying it, and it’s this little moment of calm. Stress-reducing? Maybe. It just feels like a ritual. A nice one. My cat still stares at the jar when I open it. Probably the smell.\n\nI got distracted. My point is, it worked. Like actually worked. My skin barrier or whatever felt repaired. No more flakiness under makeup. No more that tight, itchy feeling when the heater kicks on. I used to have a shelf full of products. Serums, creams, oils. This one little jar of whipped tallow balm replaced like, three of them. It’s simple. Beef tallow, some olive oil, some vanilla stuff for scent. That’s it. The natural ingredients list is so short you can read it without squinting.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Skincare Jar Again?\n\nI’m on my second one. I ordered it before the first was even empty. That’s the real review, right? I didn’t wait to run out. I told my sister about it. She has eczema and she was skeptical too, but she tried it on a patch on her arm and texted me a week later like “okay what is this magic.”\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop. The shipping took a bit because it comes from France, but it was worth the wait. It feels like someone made it carefully, not in a huge factory. That matters to me now, I guess.\n\nIt’s not a miracle. It won’t make you look 20 again. But if your skin is dry, or angry, or just feeling off, it helps it remember how to be skin. It’s deeply moisturizing without being heavy. For winter damage, for just general dry skin relief, it’s my go-to. I keep it on my nightstand.\n\nSo yeah. Beef tallow on your face. Sounds bizarre. Feels fantastic. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to the oils our own skin makes, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just sit on top. It feels like it helps your skin help itself, if that makes any sense.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this. But no, for me it didn’t. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it’s less likely to clog pores than a lot of other oils. It just melts in. If you’re super acne-prone, maybe patch test first, but it’s been fine for my combo skin.\n\n**What does the bourbon vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s hard to describe. It’s vanilla, but not the ice cream kind. It’s warmer. Deeper. Like vanilla beans and maybe a little bit of wood. It’s cozy. Not sugary. Just a really nice, comforting smell that goes away once it soaks in.\n\nAnyway. If your skin’s being difficult with the cold, this might be worth a shot. I’m just glad I got over the weirdness.",
