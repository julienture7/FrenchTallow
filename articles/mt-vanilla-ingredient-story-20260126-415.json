  "title": "This Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm Is Weird. My Skin Loves It.",
  "body": "Okay, so. Beef fat. On your face. I know. That was my exact reaction, like, two months ago. I was scrolling on my phone, it was late, my heater was making that weird clicking noise it does, and my hands looked like a dried-up riverbed. All cracked. I saw this thing for a whipped tallow balm. Bourbon vanilla scent. My brain went: “Absolutely not.” But then I bought it. I don’t know why. Desperation, maybe. Boredom. The fact it was from some small shop in France and not a big brand. Anyway, I’m typing this now with my hands actually looking like… hands. Not lizard skin. So. Let’s talk about putting cow fat on your body, I guess.\n\nIt arrived in this little jar. Cute packaging, honestly. I opened it up in my kitchen, under that harsh overhead light. The texture was… unexpected. Thick. Like really thick. But then you scoop a bit and it’s this weird, fluffy, almost cloud-like thing. Smelled like vanilla. But not birthday cake vanilla. More like… okay, remember that one fancy candle you got as a gift that was too nice to light? That kind of vanilla. Warm. Cozy. I just stood there for a second, holding this jar of whipped beef tallow, feeling deeply confused about my life choices.\n\n## How I Got Over The “Ew” Factor\n\nLook. The idea of tallow skincare is bizarre at first. I get it. My brain immediately went to cooking grease. Gross. But then I did what you do at 1 AM—I fell down a weird internet hole. And it turns out, using animal fats on skin isn’t new. It’s, like, ancient. Our great-grandmas probably used some version of this. Lard for chapped hands, that kind of thing. It’s only weird now because we’re used to everything coming from a lab in a shiny plastic bottle with a million unpronounceable ingredients.\n\nThe science-y bit, which I will butcher because I’m not a scientist: grass-fed beef tallow is supposedly really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Like, the structure of the fats is close to human sebum. So the idea is your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like some weird silicone mask; it actually gets in there and does something. It makes a kind of sense when you think about it. We’re animals. Using stuff from other animals… it’s not that crazy. Weirder than hyaluronic acid serum? Debatable.\n\nI was still skeptical. But my knuckles were literally bleeding from the winter air. So I went for it.\n\n## What This Stuff Actually Does\n\nFirst try: on my hands. I took a tiny bit of this bourbon vanilla tallow balm, rubbed it between my palms. It felt… solid at first. Then it melted. Like, it went from this firm whip to almost nothing. It didn’t feel greasy. That was the first surprise. It just felt… like my skin drank it. My hands felt softer immediately. Not slippery. Just normal, but better. The cracks didn’t magically vanish in one go, but they didn’t hurt as much.\n\nThen I got brave. My face gets so tight and angry in winter. Like a too-small sweater. I used it at night, after I washed my face. Just a little dab. Woke up and my skin didn’t have that parched, “please water me” feeling. It just felt calm. I didn’t look radically different. I just felt more comfortable in my own face. That’s a big deal, actually.\n\nHere’s the weird part—it’s not a miracle worker. It doesn’t “erase” lines. But the fine lines around my eyes, the ones that look worse when I’m dehydrated? They just looked… less noticeable. Because the skin was plumper. Happier. It’s like the difference between a raisin and a grape. Same thing, just more hydrated.\n\nI started using it on my elbows. My knees. Anywhere that gets rough and forgotten. It became my go-to for everything. I’d put it on before bed, and the bourbon vanilla smell was just this nice, calming thing. Not perfume-y. Just… warm. It made the whole routine feel less like a chore and more like a thing I did for me. While watching bad TV.\n\n## My Skin Now (And A Random Tangent)\n\nSo it’s been, what, eight weeks? Maybe nine. I’ve gone through like a quarter of the jar. A little goes a long way, which is good because shipping from France takes a minute. My hands are normal. That’s the biggest win. No more cracks. My face feels more resilient. When the wind hits it now, it doesn’t instantly scream. It’s just… fine.\n\nOh, and I told my mom about it. She’s the queen of skepticism. I gave her my jar to try for a week because she has this dry patch on her arm that nothing fixes. She called me and was like, “What is in this? It’s gone.” She ordered her own. From the same little Etsy shop I used. That’s a bigger endorsement than anything I could say.\n\nWait, I got distracted. The point is, this whipped tallow balm, specifically the bourbon vanilla one, just works. It’s simple. The ingredients list is short: grass-fed beef tallow, some oils, essential oils for scent. That’s it. No filler. No water. No mystery chemicals. In a world where my skincare shelf looks like a chemistry set, that’s weirdly refreshing.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did, actually. I got a second jar last week because I don’t want to run out. It’s become a non-negotiable. Like toothpaste. Is it strange? Sure. Do I have to explain “whipped beef tallow” to anyone who sees it in my bathroom? Yes. But I don’t care anymore. The results speak for themselves.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. If you’re vegan, obviously, this is a hard pass. And if you’re looking for some magical, instant, face-lift-in-a-jar, this isn’t that. It’s a balm. It moisturizes. It soothes. It helps your skin barrier do its job. For winter damage, for rough hands, for just general dry skin relief… it’s incredible. It’s the thing I didn’t know I needed.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is feeling like it’s made of parchment, maybe give it a shot. The whole thing is weird until you try it. Then it just makes sense.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just coat your skin—it seems to help it repair itself. My face loves it, especially in dry weather.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this. But no, not for me. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. It melts right in. If you have super oily skin, maybe just use a tiny bit at night. But for my normal-to-dry skin, it’s been perfect.\n\n**What does the bourbon vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s nice. Really warm and cozy. Not like candy or cheap perfume. It’s like a vanilla bean, but deeper. Maybe a little woody. It’s not strong, just a gentle scent that fades pretty quick after you put it on. It’s the main reason I got this scent over the unscented one—it makes using it feel like a tiny treat.",
