  "title": "My Weirdly Good Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm Situation",
  "body": "Okay so I opened the jar. It was last Tuesday, I think. Maybe Wednesday. It was cold in my apartment, the heat makes this weird clicking sound and it was doing that. My hands were dry. Like, cracking dry. I’d just washed a bunch of dishes and they felt like sandpaper. I ordered this whipped tallow balm on a whim because my friend Sarah wouldn’t shut up about tallow skincare. Beef fat. For your face. Sounded absolutely nuts to me. But she sent me the link to this Etsy shop and the bourbon vanilla scent one just… I don’t know. It sounded less weird than the unscented. Like dessert maybe. So I got it.\n\nIt arrived in this little box. I opened it on my kitchen counter. The jar’s glass, feels heavy. Good heavy. I unscrewed the lid.\n\nAnd the smell.\n\nIt wasn’t like a candle. Or lotion. Not that fake vanilla sugar cookie smell from the mall. It was… deeper? Warmer. Like if you baked vanilla beans in a really old wooden bowl. With maybe a drop of something smoky way in the background. Not smoky like a fire. Smoky like… I don’t know. Like the memory of a good smell from a bar. But not boozy. Just cozy. It just smelled good. Simple good. Not “perfume” good. More like “this will make everything feel okay” good.\n\nI stuck a finger in. The texture threw me. It’s thick. Like, really thick. Cold and solid in the jar. But then it just… melts. The second it hits your skin warmth it turns into this oil. But not a slick oil. It sinks in. I rubbed it into my wrecked hands. My cuticles. The red, rough patches by my thumbs.\n\nThey were soft in like, two minutes. Not greasy. Just… not sandpaper anymore. I just stood there smelling my hands. It was a whole thing. My cat looked at me weird.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Stopped Sounding Insane\n\nSo I was skeptical. Obviously. Putting rendered beef fat on your face sounds like something a pioneer would do during a hard winter. Not a thing you order online in 2024. But Sarah kept talking about it. And then I read a bit. This stuff is made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up in France. The big thing is it mimics human skin sebum. Our own oil. So your skin recognizes it, drinks it up deep instead of just sitting on top like a silicone blanket. That’s why it’s supposed to be good for dry skin, sensitive skin, all that. It’s like giving your skin back what it actually wants, not some lab-made chemical with a fifty-letter name.\n\nMy fancy moisturizer from the department store had a fifty-letter name. It cost a lot. It also made my forehead break out in little bumps. Go figure.\n\nSo this bourbon vanilla tallow balm became my weird science experiment. I started using it at night. After I wash my face. I’d scoop a tiny bit, warm it between my fingers, and just press it all over. The smell is the best part of the routine. It’s that warm, classic vanilla scent. Not “comforting” in a cheesy way. It’s just… it feels like a deep breath before bed. Cuts through the stress of the day somehow. My brain goes, “Oh. Vanilla. Okay. We can stop thinking about emails now.”\n\nWinter is the worst for my skin. The air inside is dry. The air outside is mean. My cheeks get these rough patches, my lips are permanently chapped. This balm fixed my lips in two days. Just a tiny dab. Healed them better than any waxy tube I’ve ever used.\n\n## What This Stuff Actually Does (Or Did, For Me)\n\nSo my routine. It’s not fancy. I’m not a ten-step person. I’m a “I’m tired and my face feels tight” person. This fits because it’s one thing. One jar. I use it on my face at night. Sometimes in the morning if I’m feeling extra dry. I use it on my hands constantly—kept the jar by the sink. Elbows. Knees. Anywhere that gets that winter-scale texture.\n\nThe absorption thing is real. It doesn’t leave a film. You don’t feel it ten minutes later. You just feel… normal. Not moisturized, not greasy. Just like your skin is finally hydrated and has decided to behave itself. I’ve used oils before and I’d wake up with a shiny pillowcase. Not with this. It just goes away. Into your skin. Where it belongs.\n\nThe scented tallow balm part is key for me, I think. The bourbon vanilla makes it feel like a treat. An enjoyable little ritual. If it smelled like, I don’t know, plain fat or herbs or nothing, it would feel more medicinal. This way, using it is something I look forward to. It’s a two-second aromatherapy session. Smell your hands, feel your skin get soft, move on with your life.\n\nIs it a miracle? No. My face didn’t suddenly look twenty-one again. But the fine lines around my eyes look… less thirsty? Plumper? I don’t know the right word. They just look less pronounced. The dry patches on my cheeks are gone. Completely. My skin just feels balanced. Even. Not screaming at me all the time.\n\nI told my sister about it. She was horrified at first. “You put what on your face?” Then she came over, tried it, smelled it… and she stole a little scoop in a contact lens case. Now she has her own jar. We’re a tallow family now, I guess.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. Because it’s so similar to the oils our own skin makes, it absorbs deep and doesn’t just clog stuff up. It’s like giving your skin food it actually knows how to digest. My sensitive skin loves it way more than the fancy stuff I used to buy.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m prone to clogging. Like I said, it absorbs. It doesn’t sit on top of your skin forming a barrier. It sinks in and sort of… hydrates from within? That sounds too fancy. It just doesn’t cause bumps for me. At all.\n\n**What does bourbon vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a warm, cozy vanilla. Not cake vanilla. More like vanilla bean pods with a tiny, tiny depth to it—that’s the “bourbon” part, I guess. It’s not sweet. It’s comforting. Smells expensive, but in a natural way. It’s the main reason I enjoy using it so much.\n\nAnyway. I’m on my second jar now. I got it from that same little Etsy shop. It just works. My skin’s happy, I’m happy, I smell like nice vanilla before bed. In the middle of winter, that’s a pretty good deal. If your skin’s being difficult and you’re curious about this whole natural tallow skincare thing, the bourbon vanilla one might be worth a shot. Start with your hands. You’ll get it.",
