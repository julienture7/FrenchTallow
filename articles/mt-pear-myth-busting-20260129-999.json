  "title": "My Honest Take on Pear Tallow Balm (Yes, the Beef Fat Stuff)",
  "body": "Look, I’m just gonna say it. I put beef fat on my face now. I know. I know exactly what you’re thinking. I thought it too. My friend Sarah said it to me over text, all caps: “YOU PUT WHAT ON YOUR FACE?” So yeah, this is about that pear tallow balm. Beef tallow skincare. It sounds like something your weird great-aunt would swear by, right next to onion poultices. I was so skeptical. But my skin was a disaster this winter. Like, flaky desert disaster. So I tried it. And now I’m typing this one beer deep on my couch, and my face feels… fine? Good, actually. Weird.\n\nIt was a Tuesday, I think. Maybe Wednesday. The one where it was sleeting. My heater was making that clicking noise it does. My knuckles were so dry they looked like a topographical map. I’d tried everything. The fancy stuff in the blue jar, the drugstore stuff, the “clean beauty” oil that cost more than my electric bill. My skin just drank it up and asked for more, still tight and sad. I was scrolling Etsy at like 11:30 PM, which is never a good idea, and I saw this little shop. Whipped tallow balm. Made in France. Scent: Pear. I stared at it. Beef tallow. For skin. The whole “is tallow good for skin” question was bouncing in my head. It sounded medieval. But the reviews were all these normal people being like “I know it sounds crazy but…” So I bought it. I didn’t tell anyone.\n\n## How I Started Using Beef Fat on My Face\n\nThe jar showed up a week later. Small. Kinda cute, actually. I opened it in my kitchen, under the too-bright LED light. My neighbor’s TV was blaring some reality show through the wall. I braced myself for, I don’t know, a barnyard smell. Raw meat vibes. I unscrewed the lid.\n\nIt didn’t smell like beef. At all. It smelled like… a pear. But not a candy pear. Not a strong perfume. Just a soft, clean, fruity smell. Subtle. I poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It was solid but soft, like cold butter that’s been sitting out for ten minutes. I scooped a tiny bit. Rubbed it between my fingers. It melted. It just turned into this silky oil. I looked at my sad, winter-worn hands. “Alright,” I said to my empty kitchen. “Let’s do this.”\n\nI put it on the back of one hand first. Like a test patch. It felt… rich. But not greasy? It soaked in. Like, really soaked in. My skin just ate it. Five minutes later, I couldn’t even tell where I’d put it, except that patch of skin was suddenly calm. Not shiny. Not sticky. Just… normal. Hydrated. Huh.\n\nSo I did my whole face. I was watching some baking show while I did it. I remember because someone was making a disastrous soufflé. I warmed a little balm in my palms and just pressed it into my skin. It felt different than anything else. It didn’t sit on top. It didn’t feel like a mask. It just sort of vanished, leaving my skin stupidly soft. And it smelled nice. Light and fresh. I went to bed thinking, “Well, I either just fixed my face or I’ll wake up looking like a glazed donut.”\n\n## Why Putting Beef Tallow on Your Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nI woke up. My face wasn’t a grease pit. It wasn’t tight. It just felt… fine. Balanced. That was new. So I started reading. And here’s the thing that made me go, “Oh.”\n\nTallow—this specific kind, from grass-fed cows—is apparently really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Like, the structure is close. Our sebum. So instead of your skin freaking out and trying to over-produce oil because you’ve stripped it with harsh stuff, or just sitting there confused by a synthetic moisturizer it doesn’t recognize, the tallow just… fits. It’s like it speaks the same language. It gets absorbed deep because your skin knows what to do with it. It’s not just sitting there pretending to moisturize. It’s actually doing the job.\n\nThat’s the beef tallow skincare secret, I guess. It’s not some magic potion. It’s just using something biocompatible. It makes a dumb kind of sense when you think about it. People used to use this stuff for centuries before shelves were packed with a thousand chemical creams. It’s simple. It’s one ingredient, whipped into this balm. All the tallow balm benefits come from it just being a really good match for human skin. Especially dry, angry, winter skin. Or hands that wash dishes. Or elbows that look like they belong to a dinosaur.\n\nI kept using it. Morning and night. On my face, on my hands. My cuticles stopped being ragged. The little fine lines around my eyes—the ones that look extra deep when I’m tired—they just seemed… less pissed off. Not gone. I’m not 19. But softer. My foundation stopped clinging to dry patches because there weren’t any. It was wild.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Pear-Scented Experiment\n\nSo it’s been a few weeks now. Maybe a month? I lost track. The sleet turned to actual snow. My heater still clicks. But my skin doesn’t hurt anymore.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is that my skin just feels quiet. Before, it was always sending signals. “I’m tight!” “I’m flaky here!” “I’m an oily mess over here!” Now it’s just… there. Being skin. It feels resilient. Like I could go walk my dog in the wind (I don’t have a dog, but you know) and my face wouldn’t feel like it was going to crack. My hands, which were the main problem, are actually smooth. I don’t have to re-lotion them six times a day. I just do the tallow balm in the morning and after dishes. That’s it.\n\nAnd the scent. I was worried it would be overpowering or get weird. But the pear scent is gentle. It’s not a dessert smell. It’s just a soft, clean, fruity thing that fades after a minute. It’s nice. Sophisticated, even. It doesn’t clash with my perfume or anything. It just makes the whole experience feel a little less… agricultural.\n\nI told my mom about it. I had to explain it three times. “Yes, Mom, tallow. From a cow. Yes, for my face. I know it sounds nuts.” She was skeptical. Then her hands got bad from all her winter gardening. I gave her my jar to try. She called me two days later. “Where did you get this?” Now she wants her own. I’m probably gonna order another one soon from that Etsy shop, maybe for her. I’m on my second jar for me already.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I would. I am.\n\nIt’s not a miracle. I still get a pimple if I eat too much cheese. I still have lines. I’m a human. But it solved the specific problem I had: my skin was chronically, desperately dry and nothing was fixing it. This fixed it. Simply. With one ingredient that sounds bizarre but works.\n\nIt feels like a cheat code. I spent so much money on complex products with twenty-five ingredients I can’t pronounce, and the thing that works is whipped beef fat and a little pear scent. It’s humbling. And kind of funny.\n\nAnyway. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nFor me, yeah, it really was. From what I understand, it’s because it’s similar to our skin’s own oils, so it gets absorbed properly and doesn’t just sit on top. It fixed my dry winter face when nothing else would.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about that too. But it hasn’t for me. It seems to absorb really well—it doesn’t feel greasy or heavy once it sinks in. My skin actually feels more balanced, not clogged. But everyone’s skin is different, I guess.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a light, fresh pear smell. Not like candy or strong perfume. It’s gentle and sweet in a natural way, and it fades pretty quickly after you put it on. It’s nice. Makes the whole thing feel less… unconventional.\n\nSo yeah. If your skin is being difficult and everything else feels like it’s just pretending to work, this might be worth a shot. It’s just one of those things you have to get past the initial “wait, what?” to try. I’m glad I did.",
