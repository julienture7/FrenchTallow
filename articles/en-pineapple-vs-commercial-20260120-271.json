  "title": "That Pineapple Tallow Balm I Tried: My Skin Got Weirdly Better",
  "body": "So I’m just gonna talk about this beef tallow balm I’ve been using. The pineapple one. It smells like a vacation. Or like a candle. A good candle. Anyway, my skin was a disaster this winter. Like, flaky desert disaster. I was using this expensive cream from Sephora—the one in the green jar, you know the one, it’s like $50—and it just sat on top of my face. Made me look greasy but still feel tight. It was stupid. I was sitting there one night, my face feeling like it might crack, and I saw an ad for this whipped tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I thought it was a joke. But I was desperate. And my hands were so chapped from washing them a million times a day. So I ordered it. From this little Etsy shop. Figured I had nothing to lose.\n\nIt arrived in this simple jar. No fancy box. Just a jar. I opened it and poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. Like cold butter but softer. It smelled like pineapple. Not fake candy pineapple, but like… pineapple. Maybe with something else. I don’t know. I was skeptical. Putting beef fat on my face? Really? But I did it. My chair was cold, the TV was on, and I just went for it.\n\n## How I Ended Up Putting Beef Fat on My Face\n\nLook, I’ve tried everything. Drugstore stuff, fancy department store stuff, that Korean skincare routine with twelve steps. My bathroom cabinet is a graveyard of half-used bottles. The last straw was this “intensive repair” lotion from a big brand. You know, the one with the commercials where people’s hands are magically healed? Total garbage. My knuckles still looked like a dry riverbed. I was so annoyed. I spent more time putting on lotion than anything else. And it never worked.\n\nSo tallow. I read about it. It’s basically rendered beef fat. From grass-fed cows. They whip it until it’s this creamy balm. The thing is, it’s supposed to be really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So it sinks in instead of just coating the top. That made sense to me. The fancy cream from Sephora just felt like a silicone mask. This tallow stuff, from France apparently, was supposed to actually absorb. Mimic human skin stuff. For deep moisture. Good for rough skin, lips, even little lines. I was like, okay, fine. Let’s try it. What’s the worst that could happen?\n\nI started with my hands. They were the worst. I scooped a little. Rubbed it in. It was cold, then it warmed up. It didn’t vanish instantly like that watery lotion. It took a second. But then it was just… gone. And my hands felt different. Not greasy. Just soft. Like my own skin but hydrated. I was shocked. So I tried it on my face that night. After I washed it. Just a tiny bit. Same thing. It soaked in. I didn’t wake up with an oil slick pillowcase. My face just felt calm. I don’t know how else to describe it.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt doesn’t do a magic trick. It’s not a miracle. It just… works. The difference between this natural tallow balm and the commercial skincare I was using is huge. The store stuff is all water and chemicals and fragrance. It gives you that instant cool feeling, then evaporates. You’re dry again in an hour. This tallow balm is just one ingredient, basically. Maybe two with the pineapple scent. It doesn’t feel like much when you put it on. But the next day, my skin is still okay.\n\nMy routine now is stupid simple. Wash face. Put on the tallow balm. That’s it. In the morning, sometimes I just splash with water and use a tiny bit more if it’s really cold out. My skin isn’t perfect. I still get a zit sometimes. But the overall texture is just better. The tight, itchy feeling is gone. My elbows aren’t rough anymore. I use it on my lips too. It’s the best natural moisturizer I’ve ever used, and I’ve tried a lot of “natural” stuff that was basically expensive water.\n\nThe scent is cheerful. It’s not overpowering. It’s just this sweet, tropical smell that makes me think of summer. Which is nice in the dead of winter. It’s not a perfume-y smell. It’s just… pineapple. It fades pretty fast after you put it on, which I like. I don’t want to smell like a fruit salad all day. I just want my skin to not hurt.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nOkay so the results. After a few weeks, I noticed my hands weren’t cracking. At all. I work on a computer all day, I wash my hands constantly, winter air is brutal. They’re just… normal now. That alone is worth it. My face is less red. The fine lines around my eyes, which I only really noticed when I was super dehydrated, look less… pronounced. They’re not gone. I’m not 20. But they’re softer.\n\nThe biggest thing is I just don’t think about my skin anymore. It’s not a problem I’m constantly trying to solve. I don’t have five different products for different issues. I have this one jar. It sits on my nightstand. I use it when I need it. It’s simple. I got one for my mom too, for her super dry legs. She called me last week and was like “what is this stuff, it’s actually good.” High praise.\n\nI’m on my second jar now. I ordered it from the same Etsy shop. The whole natural vs commercial skincare debate feels silly to me now. The commercial stuff is designed to make you buy more. To feel fancy. This tallow balm is designed to work. It’s a tool. A very effective, weird-sounding tool. I’ll take it over the fancy jar any day.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. It sounds gross, I know. But it’s really similar to the oils our skin already makes. So it absorbs deep instead of sitting on top. It doesn’t clog my pores. My skin just drinks it up.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot for me, and I have skin that can get clogged easily. Because it’s so similar to our own sebum, it seems to balance things out. It’s not like putting Vaseline on your face. It soaks in. If you’re worried, just try a little spot first.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like actual pineapple. Sweet and fruity, but not like candy. It’s a bright, happy smell. It doesn’t stick around for long after you rub it in, which is perfect. It just gives you a little tropical vibe when you open the jar.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult with regular lotions, this might be worth a shot. I was super skeptical about a tallow balm review changing my mind, but it did. It just works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all I wanted. I’m probably gonna order another one soon.",
