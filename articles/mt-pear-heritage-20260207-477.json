  "title": "Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear: My Weird Winter Skin Fix",
  "body": "So my skin was just freaking out. Like, it was December maybe, and my face felt like one of those old paper bags. Tight. Flaky. The whole thing. I was scrolling on my phone, probably on the couch with the TV on in the background, and I kept seeing this stuff. Tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I mean, come on. It sounded like something my grandma would’ve had in a tin, not a skincare thing. But I was desperate. And curious. So I went down this whole internet rabbit hole about traditional tallow skincare. Ended up ordering this Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear from some small shop. And honestly? It’s the only thing that got me through the winter. My skin’s just… calm now. I don’t know how else to put it.\n\nOkay, so beef tallow for skin. It sounds intense. I get it. My first thought was literally “rendered cow fat, cool, gonna put that on my cheekbones.” But the more I read, the less weird it got. People have been using animal fats on their skin for, like, forever. Centuries. It’s one of the oldest moisturizers there is. Before there was a whole aisle at Target for creams, this was the stuff. Lard, tallow, all of it. It fell out of fashion when everything became about chemicals and fancy jars, I guess. But now it’s having this whole natural skincare comeback. Because it works. And it’s simple. That’s the whole thing.\n\n## How I Ended Up Putting Beef Fat on My Face\n\nIt started with my hands. They crack every winter. Like, painful little splits at the knuckles. I’ve tried everything in a tube. Nothing really stuck. Then I remembered my grandma, not with tallow, but with this thick, waxy salve she kept in her bathroom. It smelled like herbs and oil. It worked on everything. Cuts, scrapes, dry patches. I figured this tallow thing was probably the same idea. Old-school. Functional.\n\nSo I looked it up. This particular balm is made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up in France until it’s this fluffy, creamy texture. The key thing—and this is what made me click buy—is that it’s supposed to be really close to our skin’s own sebum. Our skin recognizes it. So instead of just sitting on top like a lot of lotions do, it actually sinks in. Deep. It’s good for super sensitive skin, for lips that won’t heal, for just… hydrating. The one I got is scented with pear. Subtle sweetness, they said. Gentle. I needed something that wasn’t gonna smell like a perfume counter or, you know, a barnyard.\n\nAnyway, I ordered it. It arrived in this little jar. The fridge was humming that one annoying pitch it does. I opened the box.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nTexture was different. Not bad different. It’s solid but soft, like cold butter straight from the fridge. You scoop a tiny bit with your finger and it melts immediately from your body heat. It doesn’t feel greasy. That was the first surprise. It just… disappears. You rub it between your palms and pat it on, and your skin drinks it. It’s not shiny. It’s not sticky. My cat jumped on my lap right after I put it on my hands and she didn’t even do that thing where she sniffs and then looks offended.\n\nThe smell. Right. Pear. It’s not a candy pear. Not a strong, fake fruit smell. It’s light. Fresh. It’s there when you open the jar, and then it fades to almost nothing on your skin. Just a clean, soft scent. Sophisticated? I don’t know if I’d say that. It just smells nice and simple. Not like you’re trying to smell like something.\n\nI started using it at night. After washing my face, I’d take a little dab. Warm it up. Press it into my skin, especially on my cheeks and forehead where I get the driest. The first week, I didn’t notice anything crazy. But my skin didn’t feel tight when I woke up. That was new. Usually, by morning, I’m reaching for moisturizer before I even make coffee. But I wasn’t. It just felt balanced. Normal. Not oily, not dry.\n\nHere’s the weird part. I used it on my elbows. They’re always rough, you know? Like sandpaper. After a few days of putting the leftover balm from my hands on them, they were actually smooth. I showed my partner and was like “feel this!” and he was just confused about why I was so excited about elbows. But I was. It was working on the stuff nothing else worked on.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been a couple months now. Maybe more. I’m halfway through the jar. I use it every night without thinking. It’s just part of the routine, next to my toothbrush.\n\nThe flakiness is gone. Completely. The tight, papery feeling? Gone. My face just feels… fortified. That’s the word that comes to mind. Like it has a better barrier. I wore it under my makeup one really cold day, and my foundation didn’t cake up in dry patches. It just sat there, looking normal. That never happens in winter.\n\nI keep the jar on my bedside table. Sometimes I’ll put a tiny bit on my lips before bed if they’re chapped. It’s not sticky, so it doesn’t get all over the pillow. It just heals them. I sound like an infomercial, but I’m just sitting here looking at my hands. No cracks. At all. It’s February. That’s basically a miracle.\n\nI told my mom about it. She’s into all the expensive department store creams. She was skeptical. “Beef tallow? Really?” But I gave her my jar to try for a week. She called me and said her friend with eczema was asking where to get it. That’s the thing. It’s not magic. It’s just a really, really good moisturizer that comes from a place that makes sense. It’s the history of beef tallow for skin, but in a cute jar that doesn’t feel like you’re in a history documentary.\n\nWould I buy it again? I already did. I got a second jar last week because I was getting low. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes it. The whole process feels small-batch and careful. I like that. It feels like you’re using something made by a person, not a machine in a huge factory. In a world full of a hundred-step routines and serums that cost as much as my electric bill, this one simple jar does more than all of it combined for me. It’s just… skin food.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, it is. It sounds wild, but it makes sense when you think about it. Our skin produces oils (sebum) to protect itself. Tallow is really similar to that. So your skin knows what to do with it. It absorbs deeply instead of clogging stuff up. It’s like giving your skin back what the winter air and harsh cleansers strip away.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I can get clogged pores pretty easy. Because it’s so similar to our own skin oils, it seems to balance things out. It doesn’t just sit on top. It soaks in. My skin feels clear, not congested. If anything, it’s calmer.\n\n**What does the Pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a light, fresh pear scent. Not like a Jolly Rancher. More like the smell of a ripe pear when you first slice into it. It’s gentle and fades pretty quickly after you put it on. It’s just a nice, subtle touch. If you hate scented stuff, you might still like this. It’s that mild.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow thing. I went from “this is gross” to having a backup jar in my cabinet. My skin’s happy. I’m not fighting with it every morning. For a traditional approach that actually works, it’s worth a shot if your skin’s being difficult. It just… works. I don’t know what else to say.",
