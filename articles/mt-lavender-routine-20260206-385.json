  "title": "Lavender Tallow Balm: My Weirdly Effective Nighttime Thing",
  "body": "Okay so it’s like 10:30 and I just smeared beef fat on my face. Wait, that sounds bad. It’s not just beef fat. It’s this tallow balm. The lavender one. My hands were so dry from the winter air today, felt like paper, and I remembered the jar on my nightstand. I’d been using it for my elbows and stuff but then one night I was just… tired. And my face felt tight. And I was like, screw it. Let’s see what happens. That was maybe three weeks ago? I think it was a Tuesday. Anyway, this is about my tallow balm routine now, I guess. How I use this whipped tallow balm. It’s become a thing.\n\nI didn’t expect much. Beef tallow for skin sounded like something my great-grandma would have used, not me. But my skin was so mad this winter. Red. Flaky. That weird itchy patch near my eyebrow came back. I spent like $50 on some fancy cream in a silver tube and it did nothing. Made it sting, actually. So I was already annoyed when this little jar showed up. I got it from this Etsy shop, just on a whim. The description said it was whipped tallow balm made from grass-fed beef. From France. I was mostly curious. And it smelled like lavender. Not fake candle lavender, but like… actual plants. Calming. So I started with my hands.\n\n## How This Beef Tallow Stuff Ended Up on My Face\n\nThe routine wasn’t planned. It never is with me. I’m bad at routines. I forget. But this was easy because I kept the jar right next to my bed, next to my book and my charging cable and an old water glass.\n\nSo my nightly thing goes like this. I wash my face with whatever’s in the shower. Usually that Cetaphil stuff. I get out, dry off, put on my stupidly soft pajama pants (the grey ones with the little moons on them). Then I sit on the edge of my bed and check my phone for a minute. The news is always depressing so I put it down. That’s when I see the jar.\n\nI scoop out a little. The amount is… I don’t know. The size of a pea? Maybe two peas? It’s cold when you first get it. The texture is weird. Not bad weird. It’s whipped, so it’s like thick butter but softer. It melts super fast from your finger heat. I rub it between my palms first to warm it up. It goes from this firm little blob to almost nothing, just this oily feeling. But not greasy oily. Different.\n\nThen I just pat it all over my face. Forehead, cheeks, chin, the whole thing. Sometimes I do my neck if I remember. It feels… I don’t know how to describe it. It doesn’t feel like it’s doing anything at first. It just kind of disappears. My skin drinks it up. There’s no shiny film left behind after a minute, which I like. I hate that sticky pillow feeling.\n\nAnd the smell. Right. The lavender. It’s not strong. It’s just there. It smells like the plant, not candy. It’s that timeless herbal smell, I guess. It’s relaxing. My brain goes, “Oh, bedtime.” It’s become a signal. Like how dogs know the sound of their food bag. My face gets the tallow balm smell and my body’s like, okay, shut down time. Helps with the sleep thing for sure. Or maybe it’s just the ritual. Either way.\n\nOne night I got sidetracked. I put the balm on and then my cat started yowling at a moth outside the window. I spent like five minutes trying to shoo the moth out. Completely forgot what I was doing. Sat back down and my face just felt… calm. Not tight. Not anything. Just normal. That was the moment I was like, huh. This actually does something.\n\n## Why Putting Animal Fat on Your Skin Isn't Actually Gross\n\nI know, I know. Tallow. It’s beef fat. It sounds medieval. I had to look it up when I first got it because I was skeptical. Here’s what I found out, casually: tallow is similar to the oils our own skin makes. That sebum stuff. So it absorbs really deep. It doesn’t just sit on top like a silicone coat. It’s like your skin recognizes it. That’s why it’s supposed to be good for dry skin or eczema or if you’re just sensitive. It’s not introducing some weird chemical. It’s giving your skin back something it already understands.\n\nMakes sense when you think about it. People have been using animal fats forever. Before labs made stuff in tubes. My grandma used lard in pie crust. This is just… skincare lard. But fancy. Whipped and from grass-fed cows in France. Sounds better when you say it like that.\n\nMy skin is definitely sensitive. Everything makes it throw a fit. But this tallow balm? Nothing. No redness. No burning. It just… works. I’ve been using it daily with tallow for a few weeks now. My winter face is gone. That flaky patch by my eyebrow? History. My whole face just feels more even. Not “glowing” or whatever. Just not angry. It’s quiet. I didn’t know my skin could be quiet.\n\n## The Random Places I Use This Stuff Now\n\nSo it started with my face at night. But the jar is there. And my hands are always dry. So sometimes, right before I turn the light off, I’ll grab another tiny bit. Rub it into my knuckles. They used to get these little cracks in winter. Not anymore.\n\nThen my elbows. I was leaning on my desk the other day and I felt my elbow and it was… smooth. Weird. I hadn’t even been purposely putting the balm there, but I guess when I warm it in my hands, some gets on my palms and then when I lean, it transfers? I don’t know. But my elbows haven’t been this smooth since I was a kid. It’s a strange thing to notice.\n\nI even used it on a little paper cut once. Healed fast. I’m not saying it’s magic. But it’s… helpful. It’s like this multi-purpose skin fixer in a jar. My daily skincare with tallow isn’t even a big production. It’s just a step I do now. Like brushing my teeth. But more pleasant.\n\nI told my mom about it. She has eczema on her hands. Really bad. I got her a jar for her birthday last month. She texted me last week: “What is in this stuff? My hands don’t itch.” High praise from my mom, who usually thinks my skincare stuff is nonsense.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, I think so. It was for mine. From what I read, it’s close to our skin’s own oils so it gets absorbed well and doesn’t clog things up. It just helps your skin barrier do its job. My face is less dry and less reactive since I started.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t clogged mine. And my skin is the type that gets mad if I look at it wrong. It absorbs pretty fast. It doesn’t leave a greasy layer sitting on top. It just sinks in and that’s it.\n\n**What does lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nLike real lavender. Not perfume. It’s herbal and calming. It’s not super strong, just a gentle smell that fades pretty quick. It’s nice before bed. Makes the whole routine feel a bit more spa-like, even though I’m just sitting on my messy bed.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my thing now. My little jar of whipped tallow balm. I’m probably gonna order another one soon because I’m almost out. If your skin is being difficult this winter, or you’re just curious about how to use tallow balm, might be worth a shot. It’s one of those simple things that just… works. I don’t have a better explanation. Anyway, my skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
