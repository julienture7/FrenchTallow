  "title": "My Skin Got Weird This Winter. This Pear Tallow Balm Fixed It.",
  "body": "Okay so my skin just gave up this winter. Like, completely. I was scrolling on my phone one night, battery at like 12%, and my hands looked like a dried-up riverbed. It was bad. I remembered my grandma always had this little tin of something for her knuckles. She called it her “hard-working hands” salve. Never thought much about it. Then I fell into one of those internet rabbit holes—you know, where you’re looking for a recipe and three hours later you’re reading about traditional beef tallow skincare. Kept seeing it. Tallow balm this, tallow balm that. Sounded… intense. Putting beef fat on your face? But my fancy lotion wasn’t cutting it. So I figured, what’s the worst that could happen. Found this one on Etsy, the Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear. Smelled nice in the pictures. I clicked buy.\n\nIt showed up a while later. Cute jar. Cold from the mailbox.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Went From Grandma's Tin to My Bathroom\n\nSo I got curious after I ordered it. Why would anyone do this? Turns out, it’s not some new TikTok trend. It’s old. Like, really old. People have been using animal fats on their skin forever. Before there was a whole aisle at Target for creams, you used what you had. Lard, tallow, stuff like that. My grandma’s tin? Probably had lard in it, now that I think about it. Beef tallow specifically—that’s the fat from around a cow’s kidneys—it’s stable. Doesn’t go rancid fast. And here’s the thing I read that made me go “huh”: it’s similar to the oils our own skin makes. Like, the sebum. So the idea is your skin recognizes it. It’s not some weird alien chemical, it’s just… fat. A familiar fat. This whole natural skincare comeback isn’t just about plants. Sometimes it’s about going back to what people actually used for centuries because it worked and they didn’t have other options. I guess we forgot. We got shiny bottles instead.\n\nAnyway. The jar.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does (And Doesn't Do)\n\nOpening it was an experience. The texture is weird. Not bad weird. It’s whipped, so it’s like this super dense cloud? You scoop a little and it holds its shape. Then you rub it between your palms and it just… melts. Not greasy. But not nothing. It’s there. You feel it, but it sinks in. Doesn’t sit on top like a plastic film. My first thought was my elbows. They were the worst. I put a glob on before bed. Woke up and they were… different. Not perfect. But softer. Not catching on my sweater. That was day one.\n\nThe smell is nice. It’s pear, but not like a Jolly Rancher. Not super sweet. More like you walked past a pear tree. Or had a ripe one on the counter. It’s light. Fresh. Doesn’t smell like a cow, I promise. That was my big worry. It just smells clean and a little fruity. Gentle. It doesn’t announce itself all day, which I like.\n\nI got braver after my elbows. Used it on my face. I was nervous. My face is picky. But it was so dry and tight, I was desperate. Used a tiny bit. Massaged it in. My skin drank it. Like, actually drank it. No residue. No shiny film. Just… calm skin. It was wild. I kept waiting for a breakout. Nothing happened. My skin just stopped feeling like it was going to crack if I smiled.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been a few weeks now. Maybe a month? I lost track. Here’s what’s different: I don’t think about my skin anymore. That’s the biggest thing. I don’t have a routine of five products. I wash my face, I put a little of this tallow balm on if it feels dry. Sometimes in the morning, always at night. My hands don’t look scary anymore. The cracks on my knuckles are gone. Completely. My cheeks aren’t red and angry from the wind. It’s just… settled. It’s not a miracle. I didn’t turn into a dewy newborn. But I look like I’m hydrated. I feel comfortable in my own skin. Literally.\n\nI told my mom about it. She laughed. Said it sounded gross. Then she tried it on her psoriasis patch on her elbow. She texted me two days later: “What’s that stuff called again?” I sent her the link to the Etsy shop where I got mine, this small maker in France. She ordered one. That’s the real test, right?\n\nIt’s funny. I spent so much money over the years on creams in fancy packaging. This thing in a simple jar, made from grass-fed beef suet whipped into this luxurious texture, just works better. It doesn’t have a million ingredients. It’s just tallow, and some pear oil for scent. That’s it. Sometimes simple is… it. It just is.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did. I’m halfway through my first jar and I have a backup in the cupboard. For winter? It’s a no-brainer. It’s my secret weapon now. When I get out of a hot shower and my skin feels that tight, squeaky feeling, I grab this. It fixes it in like, a minute. It’s become this little ritual. The smell is calming. The whole thing feels… honest. Not like I’m being sold something.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. If you’re vegan, obviously not. If you want instant, glittery results, maybe not. This is slow and steady. It’s maintenance. It’s like giving your skin a drink of water instead of a shot of syrup. It feels right.\n\nSo if your skin is being difficult, if the cold air is winning, maybe give this traditional tallow skincare thing a shot. I was skeptical. Totally. But now? I’m just glad I found it. My skin is quiet. And in the winter, that’s kind of everything.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so close to our own skin’s sebum, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just sit on top and clog things up. It’s like it tells your skin it can chill out on producing so much oil because help has arrived.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me, and my skin is pretty reactive. Since it mimics our natural oils, it seems to sink in instead of blocking pores. It’s not like putting Vaseline on. It’s more like… feeding your skin what it already understands.\n\n**What does the Pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s nice. Really light. Like a fresh, ripe pear—not candy. Not overpowering. Just a gentle, clean, fruity smell that fades pretty quick. You mostly just smell… nothing, which is what I want from a skincare product.",
