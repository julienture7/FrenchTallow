  "title": "My Weird Winter with Pineapple Tallow Balm",
  "body": "Okay so my face was just giving up. This was back in, I don't know, early December maybe. A Tuesday. It was cold and the heater was on all the time and my skin just decided to become this tight, itchy, flaky mess. Like a lizard. A sad, thirsty lizard. I’d wake up and it felt like my cheeks were made of paper. I’d smile and it was this whole production. I was using that fancy La Mer cream my sister gave me for my birthday—the tiny jar that costs more than my car payment—and it did nothing. Zero. It just sat there feeling expensive. I tried the CeraVe stuff everyone talks about, the one in the big tub. Made it worse somehow. Felt like I’d coated my face in plastic wrap. My skin was just… angry. And I was annoyed. And it was 4 PM and already dark outside. The whole situation was very beige.\n\nAnyway, I was scrolling, you know how you do, just looking for anything. Saw someone talking about tallow balm. Beef tallow. For your face. I laughed. Out loud. In my empty living room. My cat looked at me. I was like, beef fat? On my face? Are we in the 1800s? Is this a frontier remedy? But the person was so normal about it. They were just like “yeah it works.” No fancy words. So I got curious. The algorithm heard me, I guess, because next thing I know I’m looking at this Etsy shop. They had this Whipped Tallow Balm in Pineapple. Made in France from grass-fed cows. The pictures looked nice. Simple jar. And the scent description said “tropical escape” and “vacation feeling.” I was sitting there in my sweatpants, watching sleet hit the window, thinking about a tropical escape. Sold. Or, well, clicked “Add to Cart.” I figured if I was gonna smear beef fat on my face, it might as well smell like a piña colada.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Stopped Being a Joke\n\nIt showed up in a little box. No fancy packaging, which I liked. Just a glass jar. I opened it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It was whipped, like they said, so it was super light and airy. You stick a finger in and it just gives way. Cold at first. I sniffed it. Smelled like pineapple. Not fake candy pineapple, but like… pineapple. And maybe something else. Coconut? Sunshine? I don’t know how to describe it. It just smelled good and happy. Not like beef. At all. That was my first “huh” moment.\n\nSo I put a little on the back of my hand. Rubbed it in. It melted. Like, it went from this fluffy cream to almost nothing. Just sank right in. No greasy film. No shiny residue. My hand just felt… calm. And softer. Immediately. I was sitting there staring at my hand like an idiot. My other hand, for comparison, still looked like it belonged to a desert wanderer.\n\nHere’s the thing I read later that made the lightbulb go off. Tallow—this rendered beef fat—is supposed to be really similar to the oils our own skin makes. The sebum stuff. So when you put it on, your skin’s like “oh, I know this guy” and just drinks it up. It’s not sitting on top fighting with your skin. It’s working with it. For dry skin, for eczema, for just sensitive, pissed-off winter skin, it makes this weird, ancient kind of sense. It’s not a chemical trying to trick your skin. It’s just… food for it. Good, clean food from grass-fed cows in France, apparently. Who knew.\n\n## What This Pineapple Stuff Actually Does\n\nSo I started using it. At night, mostly. After I washed my face. I’d scoop out a tiny bit—you don’t need much—and warm it between my fingers. Then just press it into my face. My whole “I’m a fancy skincare person” routine went out the window. No ten-step process. Just wash, tallow, bed.\n\nThe first week was subtle. The tightness was gone when I woke up. That papery feeling just… stopped. I didn’t have to immediately slather on moisturizer the second I got out of the shower. My foundation, which had been clinging to every flake like a mountain climber, started going on smooth again. That was the big thing. No more makeup meltdowns at 9 AM.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I noticed other stuff. The little fine lines around my eyes, the ones that look worse when you’re dehydrated, seemed less… dramatic. They didn’t vanish. I’m not 22. But they looked softer. Like my skin was actually hydrated from the inside out, not just temporarily plumped. My cheeks stopped being these two red, reactive zones. Everything just chilled out. It was this quiet, steady improvement. No miracle. Just my skin deciding to be skin again.\n\nOh, random tangent—the smell. It’s so good. It reminds me of this one specific resort pool bar in Florida I went to once like eight years ago. They had these pineapple slices on the glasses. It’s that smell. Not overpowering. Just a little cheerful whiff when you open the jar. In the dead of winter, with gray skies for days, it’s a mood booster. A two-second vacation in a jar. My boyfriend even noticed. He was like “what’s that smell, it’s nice.” And this is a man who thinks Febreze is a fragrance.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nI’m on my second jar now. The first one lasted me almost three months, using it every night. I got one for my mom too, for her eczema on her hands. She called me last week, skeptical at first of course, but now she’s like “my knuckles don’t look like cracked leather anymore.” High praise.\n\nLook, I’m not saying it’s magic. It’s beef fat and pineapple smell. But it works. In a simple, no-bullshit way that all my expensive serums and creams never did. It fixed my dry skin problem without a fuss. It’s just this solid, reliable thing in my bathroom now. Next to my toothpaste.\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop, the one that makes it in France. The whole process felt small-batch and careful, not like I was buying from some factory. That mattered to me.\n\nSo if your skin is feeling tight, or angry, or just more desert than dewy, and you’re tired of products that promise the world and deliver a greasy mess… might be worth a shot. A weird, beefy, pineapple-scented shot. For natural skincare that actually does the thing it says it will. My face is happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. Because it’s so close to our own skin’s oils, it absorbs deep and doesn’t just sit on top. It’s like giving your skin something it actually recognizes and can use. Good for super dry skin, sensitive types, even things like eczema.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I can get clogged pores easy. This stuff melts right in. It’s not heavy or greasy like you’d think. The whipped texture is light and it just… disappears. My skin feels balanced, not smothered.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nJust straight-up pineapple. The good kind. Not artificial. It’s sweet and fruity and just makes you think of summer. It’s not strong all day, just a nice little scent when you put it on. Cheerful.",
