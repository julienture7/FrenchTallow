  "title": "Pineapple Tallow Balm: My Skin Was So Mad at Me",
  "body": "Okay so my face. It was just… done. This was back in like, January maybe? The middle of winter. Everything hurt. My skin felt like that cheap paper towel, you know the brown kind in public bathrooms that just shreds if you look at it wrong. Dry skin doesn’t even cover it. It was more like my skin had declared war on the atmosphere and was losing spectacularly. I’d tried the big stuff. The La Mer cream my sister swore by that cost more than my car payment. The CeraVe tub everyone on Reddit screams about. The $4.79 Vaseline Intensive Care lotion from Target I’d slather on at 11 PM hoping for a miracle. Nothing. Just this tight, itchy, flaky feeling that made putting on makeup look like a bad plaster job.\n\nI was scrolling Etsy at 2 AM one night, my feet cold on the hardwood floor, looking for literally anything else to try. That’s when I saw it. A whipped tallow balm. Beef tallow skincare. For your face. I stared at my phone. Beef fat. You’re putting rendered beef fat on your face. I remember laughing out loud, my dog looked up at me from his bed like I’d lost it. But the shop had like, a thousand good reviews. And the scent was pineapple. “Tropical escape,” it said. “Summer vibes.” It was negative three degrees outside. My soul needed a tropical escape. So I bought it. The Whipped Tallow Balm in Pineapple. From this little French shop. I figured, at worst, I’d have a very expensive, meat-scented candle.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Even Became a Thing I Tried\n\nIt showed up a couple weeks later in this cute little jar. I opened it super skeptical. First thought: texture was weird. Not bad weird. It’s like… whipped? But dense. Like if cold butter and marshmallow fluff had a baby. You scoop a little with your finger and it’s firm, but then it melts immediately from your body heat. Cold at first. Then it just sinks in. No greasy film, which shocked me. I was expecting to look like I’d rubbed a steak on my cheeks.\n\nHere’s the thing I read after I bought it, which made me feel less crazy. Beef tallow, especially from grass-fed cows, is apparently really similar to the oils our own skin makes. The sebum stuff. So it absorbs deep instead of sitting on top like a silicone blanket. This one’s whipped, which just makes it easier to spread, I guess. Made in France. Fancy.\n\nBut the smell, man. That’s what got me. I was braced for a barnyard. Or at best, nothing. It smells like pineapple. Not a fake, cleaning-product pineapple. Like the memory of a really good pineapple Dole Whip you had on vacation once. Sweet, bright, cheerful. It doesn’t smell like beef at all. It just smells like summer decided to punch winter in the face. In my dark, dry January bedroom, that was a powerful thing.\n\nI started using it at night. After I washed my face, I’d take a tiny bit—this stuff lasts forever, you need like a pea-sized amount—and warm it between my fingers. Then just press it all over. Face, neck. My poor, destroyed hands. My lips that were constantly chapped.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does (Or, Didn’t Do)\n\nI didn’t expect much. Honest. I’ve been burned by hype before. Remember when everyone was putting snail slime on their face? Weird times.\n\nBut after like, three nights? The tight feeling was gone. Just… gone. My skin didn’t feel thirsty anymore. It felt quiet. The flakiness around my nose and eyebrows started to calm down. Makeup actually sat on top of it instead of clinging to every dry patch like a life raft. My hands, from all the washing and cold air, stopped looking like a lizard’s. The cracks on my knuckles healed.\n\nIt’s not a magic eraser. I still have lines. I still get a zit if I eat too much pizza. But the baseline state of my skin changed. From “angry desert” to “normal, hydrated land.” It’s a subtle shift but it makes everything else easier. I don’t have to think about it constantly. That’s the win.\n\nOh, random tangent—this reminds me of the hotel soap from that place in Denver I stayed at for my cousin’s wedding. It was in a pine tree-shaped bottle and smelled like a forest fire. Hated it. My point is, scent matters. If this tallow balm smelled like nothing, or worse, like tallow, I probably wouldn’t have kept using it. The pineapple scent makes it feel like a treat. A little vacation in a jar. It’s the cheerfulness factor. It doesn’t smell medicinal or “natural” in a hippie-dirt way. It just smells good.\n\n## My Skin Now & Would I Buy It Again?\n\nSo it’s been a few months. I’m maybe halfway through the jar? A little goes such a long way. I use it every night. Sometimes in the morning if it’s really brutal out. My winter skin damage is basically non-existent this year. My elbows haven’t been this smooth since… I don’t know when. Pre-pandemic maybe.\n\nI told my mom about it. She was horrified at first (“you put what on your face?”) but then she tried mine when her hands got bad from gardening. Now she has her own jar. Not the pineapple one, she got the unscented. But still.\n\nYeah, I’d buy it again. I probably will buy it again, because I don’t want to run out. It’s just become part of my routine. Wash face, tallow balm, done. It’s simple. It works. And it makes my bathroom smell like a tropical island for a second, which in February is a psychological necessity.\n\nI got mine from that Etsy shop, the French one. The shipping took a bit but it was packed really nicely, like a little present to myself.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, if all the regular lotions and potions just sit on top or don’t do anything, this might be worth a shot. A tallow balm for dry skin that’s actually cracked and angry. It sounds weird. It is a little weird. But it just… works. I don’t know what else to say.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. From what I understand, the fat composition is really close to what our skin already makes. So it absorbs like it belongs there instead of just coating the surface. It’s like giving your skin back what the weather and harsh cleansers strip away.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I can get clogged pores pretty easy. Because it absorbs so deeply, it doesn’t just sit in your pores like some heavy creams do. It feels more like it’s moisturizing from the inside out, if that makes any sense. Not greasy.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nLike actual pineapple. The sweet, fruity kind. Not candy, not cleaner. It’s bright and cheerful and doesn’t stick around super long after you rub it in, just a nice little scent burst. It’s the main reason I reach for it over the plain one—it’s a mood booster.\n\nSo yeah. If you’re curious about natural skincare and have tried everything else, maybe give tallow a look. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
