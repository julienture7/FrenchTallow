  "title": "My Weird Jar of Beef Fat: The Lavender Tallow Balm That Actually Works",
  "body": "Okay. So. I got this jar of whipped tallow balm. Beef tallow. For your face. I know. It sounds like something you’d use to grease a pan, not put on your skin. My friend sent me the link and I was like, you’re kidding. But it was winter, my face was doing that tight, angry, flaky thing it does when the heater’s on full blast, and the fancy $80 cream from the department store was just sitting there, useless. So I clicked. It’s from some small shop on Etsy, made in France. Whipped beef tallow balm, grass-fed, all that. The one I got is the lavender scent. **Lavender tallow balm**. Sounded less weird than the plain one, I guess. Figured if I was gonna smear cow fat on myself, it might as well smell nice.\n\nIt arrived on a Tuesday. I think. It was cold out. The jar was smaller than I pictured, which is always how it goes. I was sitting at my desk, there’s a coffee ring right here I still haven’t wiped, and I opened it. And… huh.\n\n## What This Lavender Tallow Balm Actually Smells Like\n\nLook. It doesn’t smell like beef. At all. That was my first worry. It doesn’t smell like fancy perfume either, thank god. I hate that. It smells like… actual lavender. But not the sharp, cleaning-product lavender. Not the dried-up little buds in a bag. It’s softer. Greener, maybe? Like if you crushed the leaves and the flower together. There’s something a tiny bit… herby underneath. Not in a bad way. It’s just a simple, quiet smell. My cat, Mittens, he jumped up and sniffed the jar and then gave me this look like *“you’re putting that on you?”* and then walked away. Very judgmental.\n\nIt’s a calming scent. That’s the word they use and for once it’s right. It’s not screaming at you. It’s just there. When you scoop some out—the texture is wild, by the way, thick like cold butter but it melts the second it touches your skin—the smell gets a little stronger. But it fades pretty fast. It doesn’t hang around all night shouting “LAVENDER!” It just sort of… introduces itself and then leaves. I like that. I use it at night, right before bed. It’s become the thing that tells my brain the day is done. Wash face, slap on this **scented tallow balm**, and that’s it. Lights out.\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face (And Why It’s Not Gross)\n\nI was super skeptical. Beef fat? Really? But then I read a bit—okay, I skimmed a Reddit thread while waiting for my laundry—and the idea is it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes. Sebum. So it’s like giving your skin back what the winter air and soap steal away. It’s not like putting mineral oil or some weird synthetic on there. It’s… compatible. That made a weird kind of sense to me. My skin’s sensitive. Everything makes it red or bumpy. This **natural lavender skincare** thing, made from just a few ingredients, seemed less likely to start a war on my face than the chemical soup in my old moisturizer.\n\nSo I tried it. On my hands first, because I’m not an idiot. They were cracked from washing them a million times a day. It felt… rich. Really rich. But it sank in. Didn’t leave my hands slick, couldn’t type after. That was promising. I moved to my face a few nights later. I was watching some baking show reruns, my feet were cold, and I just went for it. Scooped a tiny bit, warmed it between my fingers, and patted it on. It felt… different. Not cold, not hot. Just kind of… substantial. Like it was actually sealing something in. And the lavender smell was just really nice in that moment. Simple. Honest. I slept pretty well that night, actually.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI didn’t notice anything the next day. Or the day after. This isn’t a magic potion. But maybe after a week, I realized my face wasn’t tight when I woke up. That dry, stretched feeling was gone. After two weeks, the flaky patches on my cheeks and between my eyebrows just… weren’t there. I wasn’t rubbing my face constantly. My foundation, on the rare days I wear it, stopped looking like cracked desert soil by noon. It just sat there, normal.\n\nHere’s the weirdest part. I get these dry, red patches on my elbows sometimes. Psoriasis-ish, the doctor said. Annoying. On a whim, I globbed some of this **lavender tallow balm** on them one night. Thick. Like, really thick. Wore an old long-sleeve shirt to bed. Within three days, they were smoother. Less angry. I don’t have a scientific explanation. I just know it worked. My lips too. I keep a little tin of the plain stuff in my bag now for chapped lips. Works better than any stick I’ve bought.\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop, Malti. No fancy packaging, just the product. I like that. Feels real. I’m probably gonna order another jar soon because I’m halfway through this one and I don’t want to run out.\n\n## Would I Buy This Lavender Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did, actually. Got one for my mom because her hands get terrible in the winter. She called me last week and was like “What is this witchcraft?” She loves the smell too. Says it reminds her of her grandmother’s garden. So there you go.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. If you want something that feels like nothing on your skin, this isn’t it. It feels like something. It feels like… care. In a very simple, old-school way. You’re not applying a lab-engineered “complex.” You’re applying whipped, grass-fed beef tallow and lavender. That’s it. There’s something kind of grounding about that. In a world full of 30-step routines and a million serums, this is one jar. One step. Smells good. Works.\n\nI look forward to using it. That’s the best thing I can say. It’s not a chore. It’s the five seconds at the end of the day where I just… stop. Smell the lavender. Pat this weird, wonderful fat on my face, and that’s that. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. It’s just simple.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it absorbs really well and doesn’t just sit on top clogging stuff up. It’s like giving your skin back what it needs, especially when it’s dry or pissed off.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me, and my skin clogs if I look at it wrong. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t. It sinks in deep instead of forming a greasy layer. My face feels nourished, not oily.\n\n**What does lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nLike real lavender. Not perfume. More like the plant itself—green, a little herby, quiet and calming. It’s not strong or fake. It’s the main reason I like this scent for a night cream; it just helps switch your brain off.\n\nAnyway. If your skin’s being difficult, or you’re just tired of complicated products that don’t work, this might be worth a shot. It’s just a little jar of honest stuff that helps.
