  "title": "My Skin Was a Disaster. This Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm Fixed It.",
  "body": "Look, my face was a mess. It’s winter, right? The air is basically sandpaper. My skin went from normal to this tight, flaky, angry thing that felt like it might just crack off. I was using that fancy La Mer cream my sister gave me for my birthday—the tiny jar that costs more than my car payment—and it did nothing. Zero. My skin drank it up and asked for more, still thirsty. I tried the CeraVe stuff in the tub, the Cetaphil, that Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream everyone raves about. Nada. My knuckles were splitting. My cheeks looked like a dried-up riverbed. I was desperate. That’s when I saw someone mention tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I was scrolling on my phone, one beer in, my cat Bruce giving me the side-eye from the couch. I thought, *You have got to be kidding me.*\n\nBut my credit card was already out. I ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Whipped Tallow Balm from this little Etsy shop. Figured I had nothing left to lose.\n\n## How Beef Fat Became My Winter Skin Savior\n\nSo it shows up. Small jar. Simple label. I open it. Texture is… thick. Like really thick. But not in a gross way? It’s whipped, so it’s this dense, creamy paste. I poked it with my finger. Cold. I smelled it. Smelled like vanilla. But not like a candle. More like… remember those vanilla Coke bottles from the early 2000s? Or like the extract my grandma used to bake with, but warmer. Bourbon vanilla, they call it. It’s cozy. It smells like a kitchen, not a perfume counter. That was point one for it.\n\nPoint two was the skepticism. I’m rubbing beef fat on my face. This is weird. My brain kept going *this is weird this is weird*. But my skin hurt. So I did it. Washed my face, patted it dry, and scooped a tiny bit. Like half a pea. Rubbed it between my palms to warm it up—it melts fast, turns into this oily feeling—and just pressed it into my skin. My whole face. My neck. My sad, cracked knuckles.\n\nAnd then I waited for the grease slick.\n\nIt never came.\n\nThat was the wild part. My skin just… drank it. After ten minutes, it wasn’t shiny. It wasn’t sticky. It just felt like skin. But soft skin. Not tight skin. The feeling of my face pulling when I smiled? Gone. The flakes on my nose? Gone. I kept touching my cheek. It was bizarre. Bruce the cat was still judging me, but I didn’t care.\n\n## Why Tallow Balm Makes a Stupid Amount of Sense\n\nI had to look this up because it made no sense that it worked. Turns out, tallow—this is the fat from grass-fed cows—is structurally really close to the oils our own skin makes. That sebum stuff. So when you put it on, your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a silicone blanket (looking at you, every “barrier cream” ever). It actually gets in there. The one I got is from France, whipped up into this airy texture so it’s not like smearing a steak on your cheek. It’s just… efficient. It’s what my skin was begging for, and I was giving it $300 jars of mystery algae instead.\n\nMy bathroom sink looked like a skincare graveyard. The La Mer, the Drunk Elephant Lala Retro, that Vichy Mineral 89 serum. All these complicated potions in fancy bottles. And the thing that fixed me was fat in a mason jar. The irony is not lost on me. I feel like a sucker.\n\nWait, that reminds me of a tangent. Last week I was at Target getting toothpaste, and I wandered down the skincare aisle. So many bottles. So many promises. “72-hour hydration!” “Barrier repair!” “Clinical strength!” It’s all noise. I stood there for a minute just looking at it all, this wall of brightly colored plastic, and I had this dumb moment of clarity. I don’t need an 11-step routine. I need one thing that works. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a text from my mom asking what I wanted for dinner. The universe has a weird sense of humor.\n\nAnyway. Back to the tallow.\n\n## What My Skin Looks Like After a Month of This Stuff\n\nI’ve been using it every night. Sometimes in the morning if it’s really cold. I’m not poetic about this, I’ll just tell you what happened.\n\nMy face doesn’t hurt anymore. That’s the biggest thing. Washing it doesn’t feel like a punishment. The flakiness around my nose and eyebrows—totally gone after like, four days. My makeup (when I bother) goes on smoother. Not “perfect,” but smoother. Like my skin isn’t fighting it.\n\nBut the real shocker was my hands. I wash my hands constantly. They were a war zone. Red, cracked, stinging. I’d been using that O’Keeffe’s Working Hands stuff, which helps a bit but feels like spackle. One night, I just globbed the tallow balm on my hands like I was buttering corn. Put on some cheap cotton gloves I found in a first-aid kit and went to sleep. Woke up. My hands were… normal. Not “model hands,” but the cracks were closed. The redness was down. They just looked like hands again. Not zombie hands.\n\nI don’t know how else to say it. It just works. It’s not magic. It’s not going to turn back time. But it fixed the basic problem: my skin was dry and damaged, and now it’s not. It’s quiet. It’s comfortable. It’s like my skin finally took a deep breath and relaxed.\n\n## Would I Buy This Bourbon Vanilla Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nI’m on my second jar. The first one lasted me about six weeks, using it on my face, neck, and hands almost daily. A little goes a seriously long way. I got one for my mom, too, because she has eczema on her elbows and she’s tried everything. She texted me last week: “What is in this witchcraft? My elbows haven’t been this smooth since I was twenty.” High praise from a woman who is generally skeptical of everything I recommend.\n\nIf you’re curious, the shop is **PureMalti** on Etsy. That’s where I got mine. No, they’re not paying me. I just like it when things actually do what they say they’ll do. It’s a nice change.\n\nSo, if your skin is feeling tight, or rough, or just generally pissed off at the weather, maybe give it a shot. Start with a tiny bit. See what happens. Worst case, you’re out like thirty bucks and you have a very interesting conversation starter for your bathroom shelf.\n\nBest case? Your skin stops hurting. And that’s a pretty good deal.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to our own skin oils, it absorbs way better than a lot of plant oils or synthetic stuff. It doesn’t just sit there. It’s like giving your skin what it’s already trying to make.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I’m prone to getting clogged pores. I think because it actually sinks in, it doesn’t just block everything up. It feels more like it’s fixing the barrier so your skin chills out and stops freaking out.\n\n**What does Bourbon Vanilla tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like real vanilla. Not cake. Not candy. It’s warm and kind of comforting, like baking on a Sunday. The bourbon part just makes it deeper, less sweet. It fades pretty quick after you put it on. You’re not walking around smelling like a dessert.",
