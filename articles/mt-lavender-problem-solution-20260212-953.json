  "title": "Lavender Tallow Balm: My Weird Winter Skin Thing",
  "body": "So my face was just. Done. It was like, the middle of February maybe, and everything was cold and the air was that weird dry kind that makes your skin feel tight. Like a drum. I was using this expensive cream from Sephora, the one in the green jar that everyone talks about. La Mer? No, that’s not it. It was the Drunk Elephant one. The Protini stuff. Felt okay going on but an hour later my cheeks were back to feeling like sandpaper. And my hands. God, my hands looked like a topographical map of the moon. Cracks by the knuckles. It was bad.\n\nI was scrolling on my phone one night, the heater was making that clicking noise it does, and I saw this thing about tallow balm. Beef tallow skincare. For your face. I remember just staring at the screen. Beef fat. On my face. I mean, come on. That sounds like something your great-grandmother would have used before they invented, you know, actual skincare. But the person talking about it seemed normal. Not like a weirdo. And they said it was good for dry skin. Really good. And my skin was officially a desert.\n\nAnyway, I was desperate. So I clicked over to this little Etsy shop. The pictures looked nice. Simple. They had this whipped tallow balm in a lavender scent. Said it was calming. Made in France from grass-fed cows, whipped up into this creamy thing. I was half watching some cooking show and my cat was giving me that judgmental look from the armchair, and I just thought, screw it. My credit card was already out from ordering pizza. What’s one more weird internet purchase?\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face\n\nIt showed up in a little brown box. No fancy packaging. Just a glass jar. I opened it in my kitchen, under the weird fluorescent light. First thought: it looks like butter. Whipped butter. I poked it. It was firm but soft. Not what I expected.\n\nThe smell. Okay. Lavender tallow balm. I was worried it would smell like a barn or something. Or like fake, potpourri lavender. It didn’t. It smelled like… lavender. But not the sharp kind. More like the plant itself, if you crushed it in your hands. Herbal. Clean. A little earthy underneath, but in a good way. It was a simple smell. It didn’t fill the room. Just… nice. I put the jar on my nightstand.\n\nI didn’t use it for three days.\n\nI kept looking at it. Beef tallow. For my face. I googled it again. Apparently, the fat from cows—the suet—is really similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So it absorbs deep, doesn’t just sit on top. It’s supposed to be good for sensitive skin, too. Even stuff like psoriasis. That made a weird kind of sense. Like recognizing itself. My $80 bottle of serum wasn’t recognizing anything except my bank account.\n\nSo one night, after I washed my face, I just went for it. I scooped a tiny bit out. It warmed up real fast between my fingers. Went from buttery to almost oily, but not greasy. I patted it on. Cheeks, forehead, neck. It felt… different. Not cold. Not slick. It just sort of sank in. Didn’t feel like much of anything after a minute. I went to bed thinking, well, I’ve done it. I’ve put cooking fat on my face. This is my life now.\n\n## What This Lavender Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nHere’s the thing. I didn’t wake up transformed. No magical glow. My face just felt… quiet. Not tight. Not screaming for moisture. Just normal. That was new.\n\nI kept using it. Morning and night. Just that. I stopped with the seven-step routine. Just cleanser and this tallow stuff. My skin stopped freaking out. The red, dry patches on my cheeks? Gone in like, four days. The little flaky bits around my nose? History. It was wild.\n\nIt’s not a dramatic “wow” thing. It’s a “huh, my face doesn’t hurt anymore” thing. It’s the absence of a problem. My skin just calmed down. The lavender part… I don’t know if it’s psychosomatic, but putting it on at night became this little ritual. The smell is so simple and herbal. It doesn’t smell like perfume. It smells like a plant. It does feel calming. Like a signal to my brain that the day is over. I’d put it on, read for a bit, and just konk out. Better sleep? Maybe. Or maybe I was just less stressed because my face wasn’t itchy.\n\nOh, and my hands! I started using the leftovers on my hands after I did my face. The cracks healed. Actually healed. Not just covered up. I work on a computer all day and in the winter my hands are a disaster zone. This stuff fixed them. It’s like it gave my skin what it was missing all along, instead of just putting a temporary blanket over the issue.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks & A Random Thought\n\nSo it’s been a couple months now. I’m on my second jar. I got one for my mom, too, because she has that super sensitive skin that reacts to everything. She texted me last week like “what is this magic butter?” So that’s a win.\n\nMy skin isn’t “perfect.” I still get a zit if I eat too much sugar. But it’s balanced. It’s not a dry, tight desert or an oily mess. It’s just… skin. It feels healthy. It looks even. I don’t wear foundation anymore, just a little tinted sunscreen. That’s a big deal for me.\n\nThis reminds me of a totally random thing. That hotel in Denver I stayed at for my cousin’s wedding. They had this amazing rosemary soap in the bathroom. It was so good I stole the extra bar. It just worked. Didn’t dry me out, smelled incredible. This tallow balm gives me that same feeling. It’s not trying to be a million things. It’s just one thing, done really, really well. It’s a simple solution to a dry skin problem that I was overcomplicating with a million products.\n\nI sound like a hippie. I’m not. I just found something that works.\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. Obviously. I already did.\n\nLook, I was the biggest skeptic. Beef tallow? Seriously? But it’s one of those things you just have to try to get it. The idea is weird. The reality is… it’s just a good moisturizer. A really, really good one. For dry skin, for winter skin, for skin that’s just pissed off at the modern world. It’s the definition of natural skincare because, well, it’s literally just one ingredient, whipped with some essential oil.\n\nIf you’re curious, it’s worth a shot. I got mine from a shop on Etsy called “GroundedEarthyStuff” or something like that. They just make this and a few other scents. No fancy website. Just the stuff. It’s not cheap, but the jar lasts forever because you need so little. And it works better than any of the fancy department store things I’ve tried.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my weird winter skin story. My face is happy. I’m happy. I’m gonna keep using my lavender tallow balm.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. It sounds gross but it makes sense. The fat molecules are really similar to the oils our own skin produces. So it absorbs deep and tells your skin to chill out, instead of just coating the surface. It’s like giving your skin something it actually recognizes.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I’m prone to clogged pores. Because it absorbs so well, it doesn’t just sit there and gunk things up. It’s non-comedogenic, which is a fancy word for “won’t clog your pores.” My skin actually got clearer.\n\n**What does lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like real lavender. Not candle lavender or perfume lavender. Like if you rubbed the purple flowers between your fingers. It’s herbal and a little earthy. Very calming. Not strong or fake at all. It’s a nice, clean, natural smell.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, especially in the winter, this might be worth a shot. It was for me.",
