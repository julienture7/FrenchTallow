  "title": "My Weird Winter Skin and the Pear Tallow Balm That Fixed It",
  "body": "Look, my face was a mess. It was January, the kind of January where the air feels like it’s actively stealing moisture from your pores, and my skin had decided to stage a full-scale rebellion. Dry patches on my cheeks that felt like sandpaper. This tight, itchy feeling all the time. I was sitting there, on my couch that’s seen better days, with a blanket that smells vaguely of dog no matter how many times I wash it, and I just poked my cheek and thought, *this is ridiculous*. I’m 34. I’ve tried everything. The fancy stuff, the cheap stuff, the stuff that comes in the shiny blue bottle from the department store that costs more than my electric bill. Nothing worked. Or it worked for a day and then my skin was like, nah, we’re going back to the desert. So I’m scrolling on my phone, half-watching some cooking show, and I keep seeing this word. Tallow. Beef tallow balm. For your face. And my first thought was, absolutely not. That sounds like something my great-grandmother would have used, and also, beef? On my skin? I eat beef. I don’t want to wear it.\n\nBut the algorithm, man. It knows. It just kept showing me this one thing: a Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear scent. Made in France. From grass-fed cows. The pictures looked… normal. Not weird. Just a little jar. And the description said it was good for eczema and chapped skin and all that. My hands were cracked from washing them a million times a day. My lips were perpetually peeling. I was desperate. So I did the thing. I clicked buy. From this little Etsy shop. Figured, what’s the worst that could happen? I waste thirty bucks. I’ve wasted more on a bad pizza.\n\n## How Beef Fat Ended Up on My Nightstand\n\nOkay so it arrives. It’s a Tuesday, I think. Maybe Wednesday. It was raining, that annoying drizzle kind that just makes everything feel damp and cold at the same time. The package was small. Unassuming. I opened it right there in my kitchen, next to the pile of mail I haven’t sorted. The jar itself is glass, which felt nice. Heavy. Not cheap. I unscrewed the lid.\n\nHere’s where I expected something… farm-like. Animal-ish. I braced myself.\n\nIt didn’t smell like beef. At all. It smelled like a pear. But not a candy pear or a super strong perfume pear. It was light. Fresh. Like you just sliced a pear open and that first whiff of it, that subtle sweetness, hits you. Gentle. Not overpowering. Sophisticated? I guess? I don’t know how to describe scents. It just smelled clean and fruity and nice. Nothing weird.\n\nThe texture was the next surprise. I scooped a little with my finger. It’s whipped, so it’s this fluffy, cloud-like consistency. Not greasy. Cold at first, from sitting in my cold kitchen. I rubbed it between my fingers. It melted. Like, instantly. Into this silky oil. But not an oily oil. A dry oil? Is that a thing? It just sank into my skin. No residue. My hands, which were dry and sad looking, suddenly looked… calm. And they felt soft. Not sticky soft. Just normal soft. Like they hadn’t just been through a winter war.\n\nI was intrigued. Still skeptical, but intrigued. That night, after I washed my face—with that Cetaphil cleanser that’s fine, it’s just fine, it doesn’t do anything bad but it doesn’t do anything good either—I decided to go for it. I took a tiny bit of the tallow balm. About the size of a pea. Rubbed it between my palms to warm it up, and then just patted it all over my face. Neck too. Why not.\n\nIt felt… different. Not like my CeraVe moisturizer in the big tub. That one sits on top, you know? You can feel it. This tallow stuff? It was like my skin drank it. It was there, and then it wasn’t. My face just felt… hydrated. Not shiny. Not greasy. Just comfortable. For the first time in weeks, it didn’t feel tight. I went to bed thinking, well, at least it doesn’t smell like a barn.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does (Or What I Think It Does)\n\nI’m not a scientist. I barely passed high school biology. But I looked it up because I was curious. Why would this work when my La Mer dupe from the drugstore didn’t? Apparently, beef tallow from grass-fed cows is structurally really similar to the sebum our own skin produces. Our skin recognizes it. So instead of just sitting on top as a barrier, it gets absorbed deep down and tells your skin, “Hey, it’s cool, we’re good, you can chill out on the oil production.” Or something like that. It mimics human skin oil. Which makes sense when you think about it. People have been using animal fats on their skin forever. Before there was a Sephora on every corner, there was lard and tallow.\n\nI used it every night. Morning too, on the extra-dry spots. After about four days, I noticed the sandpaper patches on my cheeks were gone. Not better. Gone. The itchy feeling? Never came back. My makeup, when I bothered to put it on, stopped clinging to every flake and just… went on smooth. It was weird. A good weird.\n\nHere’s a random thing. It reminds me of this hotel I stayed at in Denver once for a work thing. They had this amazing hand soap in the bathroom. It lathered like a dream and left your hands feeling incredible, not stripped. I stole like three little bottles of it. This tallow balm gives me that same feeling of simple, effective luxury. Not because it’s fancy, but because it just works without a million ingredients you can’t pronounce.\n\nAnd my lips! I used to be a chronic lip balm addict. The tube by the bed, one in my purse, one in my car, one at my desk. Applying constantly. With this, I just swipe a tiny bit of the tallow balm on my lips at night. That’s it. I wake up and they’re smooth. No peeling. I haven’t touched my other lip balms in weeks. They’re just sitting in a drawer, confused.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks & The Etsy Shop Thing\n\nSo it’s been, I don’t know, maybe two months now? I’m on my second jar. I ordered it from the same Etsy shop, *Malti*. The whole process was easy. No drama. The jar lasts a surprisingly long time because you need so little. A little truly goes a long way, which is a cliché but in this case it’s actually true.\n\nMy skin isn’t “perfect.” I still get the occasional stress pimple. I have lines. I’m getting older, whatever. But it’s balanced. It’s not freaking out. It just feels… healthy. Resilient. When I come in from the cold now, my face doesn’t scream in protest. It’s just like, oh hey, you’re back. My hands, which used to get these painful cracks at the knuckles in winter, are totally fine. I use the balm on my elbows too, which were always a bit rough. They’re smooth now. I don’t know when that happened. I just noticed it one day.\n\nI told my mom about it. She has eczema on her hands that flares up badly. She was even more skeptical than I was. “Beef fat, really?” But she tried it. She texted me last week: “What was that stuff you sent me? My hands haven’t looked this good in years.” I didn’t even send it to her as a miracle cure. I was just like, “Hey, this is working for me, maybe try it on that one rough patch.”\n\n## Would I Buy This Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nIt’s become one of those things I just have. Like my favorite coffee mug or the specific brand of socks I buy. It’s not a glamorous part of my routine. It’s just a small glass jar on my bathroom counter. But it fixed a problem that a whole shelf full of expensive, beautifully marketed products couldn’t. There’s something deeply satisfying about that. And the pear scent is just… pleasant. It’s not a perfume. It’s just a nice, light, fresh smell that disappears after a minute, leaving you with just the feeling of good skin.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s just really good, simple skincare. Sometimes the oldest ideas are the best ones. Who knew.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, feeling tight, flaky, or just generally pissed off at the weather, it might be worth a shot. I got mine from Malti on Etsy. No one’s paying me to say this. I just really like the stuff. My skin’s happy, I’m happy, and that’s all I wanted.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. From what I understand, the fat from grass-fed cows is super similar to the oils our own skin makes. So your skin knows what to do with it. It absorbs deeply instead of sitting on top. It’s like giving your skin something it actually recognizes and can use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this too because my skin can get congested. But no, for me it didn’t. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. Because it absorbs so well, it doesn’t just sit there and gunk things up. My skin actually feels clearer since using it, probably because it’s properly hydrated and not over-producing oil to compensate.\n\n**What does the Pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light. Like a real, fresh pear—that subtle sweetness when you first cut one open. Not candy-sweet or perfumey. It’s gentle and fresh and fades away pretty quickly after you apply it. It’s just a nice little scent experience when you open the jar.",
