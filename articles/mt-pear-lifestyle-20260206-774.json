  "title": "My Honest Take on Pear Tallow Balm: What Actually Happened to My Skin",
  "body": "Look, I was just trying to not look like a lizard. That’s the whole story. It was February, the heater was clicking nonstop, and my face felt like old paper. You know the feeling. Tight. Sort of itchy. I’d been using that fancy cream from the department store, the one in the heavy glass jar that cost more than my electric bill. It smelled like a garden and did absolutely nothing. My skin just drank it up and asked for more. I was scrolling on my phone one night, half-watching some baking show, and I saw someone talking about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I almost laughed. But my hands were so dry they were cracking by my knuckles, and I was desperate. So I ordered the Whipped Tallow Balm in Pear from this little Etsy shop. I figured, at worst, I’d have a weird story.\n\nIt showed up in a little cardboard box. No fancy packaging. Just a jar. I opened it and poked it. Thick. Like really thick. But not greasy? It was weird. Smelled like pear, I guess. Or not. Something. A soft, fruity kind of smell, not like candy, just… fresh. I was skeptical as hell. Putting beef tallow on my face felt like a step back to the 1800s. But the description said it was whipped tallow from grass-fed cows, made in France, and that it mimics your skin’s own oils. My skin’s oils were clearly on strike, so I gave it a shot.\n\n## How I Started Using Tallow on My Face\n\nOkay, so my first attempt was a disaster. I used way too much. I scooped out a big glob like it was my old moisturizer. Big mistake. My face looked like I’d rubbed a candle on it. Shiny. I sat there for ten minutes waiting for it to sink in, feeling ridiculous. My cat was judging me. I finally wiped most of it off with a towel. The next night, I used less. A tiny amount, like half a pea. I warmed it between my fingers first. That was the trick. It melted into this silky oil and then I just patted it on. And it… vanished. Like my skin ate it. No shine. No weird film. Just my face, but not thirsty anymore. That was the first “huh” moment.\n\nI kept using it. Not as some grand natural skincare routine experiment, but because I was lazy and it was right there on my nightstand. My old $80 cream got moved to the back of the shelf. This became the thing I slathered on after washing my face. Every night. Sometimes in the morning if it was really cold. Tallow balm daily use just happened. I didn’t plan it.\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nSo I looked it up after the fact, because I was curious why this wasn’t just making me break out. Turns out, it’s simple. Beef tallow is structurally really close to human sebum. That’s the oil our skin makes. So when you put it on, your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a synthetic barrier; it gets absorbed. Deep. It’s like giving your skin the building blocks it’s already trying to use. My fancy cream was probably full of water and silicones that just evaporated or created a fake smooth layer. This was different. It was feeding my skin, not just covering it up. That’s the switch to natural products, I guess. You’re not masking the problem, you’re giving your skin what it actually needs to fix itself.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt’s not magic. Let’s be clear. I didn’t wake up with baby skin. But after a week, the tight, papery feeling was gone. Completely. My foundation stopped clinging to dry patches around my nose. That was the first real result I noticed. Then my hands. I’d been putting the leftover bit on my hands after doing my face. The cracks by my knuckles started to heal. They didn’t sting when I washed them. For someone who’s dealt with rough hands every winter, that was huge.\n\nThe pear scent is gentle. It’s not a perfume-y smell. It’s just a light, fresh fruitiness that fades pretty quick. It doesn’t clash with anything. I like it. It makes the whole experience feel a little less… medical. I got mine from **Malti Skincare on Etsy**, by the way. Just a normal shop, not a big brand. The jar’s lasting forever because you use so little.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks\n\nThe best way to describe it is… quiet. My skin just stopped complaining. No more random dry spots. No more that tight feeling an hour after moisturizing. When I smile, my face doesn’t feel like it’s going to crack. It just feels like skin. Hydrated skin. It looks healthier. Not “Instagram filter” healthy, but like I’m drinking enough water and sleeping okay. My partner even said, “Your face looks less red,” which was a shock because I didn’t even know he noticed that stuff.\n\nI’ve read tallow is good for things like eczema and psoriasis too, which makes sense if it’s that good at calming down my winter dryness. It just creates this really resilient barrier. Wind doesn’t bother it as much. Cold air doesn’t zap it dry instantly. It’s like my skin finally has its coat on.\n\n## Would I Buy It Again\n\nYeah. I already have. I’m on my second jar. I got one for my mom too because her hands get terrible. She called me last week and said, “What is this beef stuff? It’s working.” High praise.\n\nIt’s one of those things that sounds weird until you try it. Switching from my complex 5-step routine with a bunch of chemical names to a single jar of whipped tallow felt backwards. But sometimes simple is better. My skin definitely thinks so. I’m not throwing out all my other products, but this is the anchor. The thing I know will work when everything else is being fussy.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s so similar to the oils our own skin produces, it absorbs deeply and helps reinforce your skin’s barrier instead of just sitting on top. It’s like giving your skin food it actually knows how to use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. It absorbs really well. The key is to use a tiny amount—like, seriously, less than you think you need—and warm it up in your hands first.\n\n**What does pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s a light, fresh, fruity smell. Not like pear candy, more like the actual fruit. It’s subtle and doesn’t stick around long after you put it on. It’s just a nice, gentle scent.\n\nAnyway. If your skin’s being difficult with the dry air, or you’re just tired of complicated products that don’t deliver, this might be worth a shot. It’s just a simple thing that works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy, I’m happy, and the jar on my dresser is almost empty. I should probably order another one soon.",
