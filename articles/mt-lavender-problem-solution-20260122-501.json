  "title": "My Weird Lavender Tallow Balm Experiment: What Actually Happened to My Skin",
  "body": "Look, my skin was just… done. It was January, maybe the 12th? A Tuesday. The air was that kind of dry cold that feels like it’s sucking the moisture right out of you. My face, my hands, especially my elbows—they were all staging a full-scale rebellion. Flaky patches on my cheeks that no amount of scrubbing would fix, and my knuckles were so cracked they looked like a dried-up riverbed. I was sitting on my couch, one beer in, half-watching some cooking show, and I just kept rubbing my thumb over this rough patch on my wrist. It was annoying. A constant, scratchy reminder that my body was falling apart. I’d tried everything. The big tub of CeraVe from Target. That fancy La Roche-Posay stuff my friend swore by. Even slathered on pure Vaseline like a greased pig before bed. Nothing. It’d feel okay for an hour and then my skin would just drink it up and go back to being a desert. I was scrolling on my phone, probably looking at memes, and this ad for a tallow balm popped up. Beef fat. For your face. I almost laughed. But my wrist was so itchy. I was desperate. So I clicked.\n\nAnyway, that’s how I ended up ordering this whipped tallow balm with lavender. From some little shop on Etsy. I figured, worst case, I’m out thirty bucks and I have a weird jar of beef fat to confuse my guests with.\n\n## How I Started Putting Beef Fat on My Face\n\nLet’s be real. The whole idea sounds gross. Tallow. It’s beef suet. You cook with it. I remember my grandma talking about rendering it, the whole house smelling like a roast. The thought of smearing that on my dry skin was… a lot. But the description said it was from grass-fed cows, whipped into this creamy texture, and made in France, which for some reason made it sound fancier. Like, oh, *French* beef fat, how chic. The lavender part sold me, I guess. I needed something calming. My skin was stressed, I was stressed—it was a whole thing.\n\nIt showed up in a little brown box. The jar itself was smaller than I thought. I opened it right there in my kitchen, under the weird fluorescent light. I braced myself for a barnyard smell.\n\nIt didn’t smell like beef. It smelled like… lavender. But not like a candle or a cheap air freshener. More like the actual plant, if you crushed it in your hands. A little earthy underneath. Not sweet. Just… herbal. Simple. The texture was the real surprise. I was expecting grease, like lard. But it was this fluffy, almost cloud-like cream. I poked it. It was solid but soft, like cold butter that’s just starting to soften. I scooped a tiny bit onto my finger. It felt cool. Then I rubbed it on the back of my hand. It melted. Like, really melted. Into nothing. No greasy film, no shiny residue. My skin just… drank it. And it felt softer immediately. Not slippery-soft, but actually hydrated-soft. Huh, I thought. Okay.\n\nSo that night, I washed my face with my normal stuff and, feeling ridiculous, patted my face dry and then smoothed a little of this tallow balm all over. I went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball.\n\nI didn’t. My face just felt normal. Calm. For the first time in weeks.\n\n## Why This Tallow Stuff Actually Makes Sense (I Think)\n\nI got curious after that first weirdly successful night. I fell down a Google hole instead of working. Here’s what I gathered, in my non-expert, just-read-some-stuff way. Our skin produces its own oil, right? Sebum. Apparently, beef tallow is chemically really similar to human sebum. Way more similar than, like, coconut oil or mineral oil or whatever’s in most lotions. So your skin recognizes it. It doesn’t just sit on top like a plastic wrap; it actually gets absorbed and tells your skin it can chill out on the oil production. It’s like giving your skin something it already knows how to use. For dry skin or eczema or just winter damage, it makes a stupid kind of sense. It’s not a miracle. It’s just… compatible.\n\nI kept using it. Not just on my face. My poor, destroyed hands. My elbows, which I swear had the texture of an elephant’s knee. After my shower, when my skin was still damp, I’d use a little scoop. The lavender smell was actually really nice at night. Not perfumey. Just… quiet. It became part of my routine. Brush teeth, splash water on face, tallow balm, bed.\n\nOh, tangent—the smell reminds me of this little sachet my mom used to keep in her linen closet. Not the same, but that same feeling. Clean sheets, quiet house. It’s a sleep-promoting scent for real. I’d put it on and my brain would just go, “oh, bedtime.” Way better for anxiety relief than scrolling through my phone, that’s for sure.\n\n## What My Skin Looks Like Now (No Filter, I Promise)\n\nSo it’s been a few weeks. Maybe a month? I lost track. Here’s the honest take.\n\nThe flaky patches on my cheeks are gone. Not “covered up by lotion” gone, but actually gone. The skin there is just… skin. My foundation doesn’t cling to weird dry spots anymore. My hands are the biggest win. I work on a computer all day and wash my hands a ton, so they’re always the first to suffer. The cracks on my knuckles healed. They’re not baby-soft or whatever—they’re working hands—but they don’t hurt. They don’t split open when I make a fist. That alone is worth the price.\n\nMy elbows. Okay, this is the weirdest one. They’re smooth. I didn’t even realize how rough they were until they weren’t. I was leaning on my desk the other day and I was like, “huh, that’s not sandpapery.” It’s a small thing. But it’s my thing.\n\nIt’s not a dramatic overnight transformation. It’s subtle. It’s my skin just finally being okay. Not screaming for moisture, not oily, not tight. Just… balanced. I didn’t expect a natural skincare thing, especially one as old-school as a tallow balm, to be the thing that did it. After all those fancy bottles with unpronounceable ingredients.\n\nI’m almost out of the jar. I’m definitely ordering another one. I even got one for my mom, who has eczema on her arms. She was skeptical too. “Beef fat, really?” But she called me last week and said her arms haven’t itched in days. So. There’s that.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, I think so. It sounds nuts, but it makes sense if you read about it. It’s similar to the oils our skin makes naturally, so it absorbs really well and doesn’t just clog stuff up. My face loves it, and my face is usually pretty picky.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I’m prone to getting little clogged pores around my chin. This stuff melts right in. It’s not like putting Vaseline on. It feels more like it’s feeding my skin, not smothering it. My skin actually seems clearer since I started using it, which I did not see coming.\n\n**What does the lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like real lavender. Not candy or perfume. More like dried herbs, a little earthy, very calm. It’s not strong. It’s just this nice, quiet herbal smell that fades pretty fast. It’s the main reason I use it at night—it just feels relaxing.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my unexpected tallow balm story. If your skin is being difficult, especially with the dry winter air, and the usual stuff isn’t cutting it… might be worth a shot. It’s just a weird little jar that works. I don’t know what else to say. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.",
