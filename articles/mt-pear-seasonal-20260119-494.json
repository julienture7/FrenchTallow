  "title": "That Pear-Smelling Tallow Stuff I Tried This Winter",
  "body": "My face felt like paper. You know that feeling? When the heat kicks on and the air gets so dry it’s like the moisture just gets sucked right out of you. It was December, maybe. The 12th? I was sitting on my couch and I could feel my cheeks just… pulling. Tight. Like if I smiled too big something might crack. That’s my winter skin. It goes from normal person to flaky, angry desert creature overnight. My knuckles look like a topographical map of the moon. It’s bad.\n\nI’d tried everything. The thick creams in the blue tub from the drugstore. The fancy stuff my sister gave me for my birthday that cost more than my electric bill. They’d sit on top of my skin, all greasy, and I’d still wake up feeling like a lizard. I was scrolling on my phone one night, my hands so dry they were catching on the blanket, and I saw someone talking about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I laughed. Out loud. It sounded like something my great-grandma would have used, not a winter skincare thing. But the person kept saying it worked. Like, actually worked. I was desperate. My skin was a disaster. So I figured, what’s the worst that could happen? I smell like a kitchen? I already felt like a dried-up piece of jerky. Might as well.\n\nI found this little Etsy shop. The jar said “Whipped Tallow Balm - Pear.” Made in France, from grass-fed cows. They whip it so it’s not like… a lump of fat. It looked soft. I opened it. Smelled like. I don’t know. Nice though. Not like beef. Not like a strong pear candy. Just a little sweet. Fresh. Like someone peeled a pear in the next room. It was weirdly calming.\n\n## Why I Even Put Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nLook, I had to look this up because I wasn’t just gonna slap cow fat on my face without knowing why. It sounds gross when you say it fast. But the basic idea, from what I read, is that tallow is kinda close to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So instead of just sitting on top like a plastic wrap, it sinks in. It’s like it speaks the same language as your skin. That made a weird kind of sense to me. All those other creams felt foreign. This didn’t seem as crazy after that. Still a little crazy. But a logical crazy.\n\nMy routine before was a whole production. Cleanse, tone, serum, moisturizer, eye cream… it took forever and my skin was still mad at me. Now? I wash my face. Sometimes just with water in the morning. And I put a little scoop of this tallow balm on. That’s it. I warm it up between my fingers and just press it in. On my face, my neck, the backs of my hands. My sad, cracked knuckles. It melts. It doesn’t feel greasy after a minute. Just… soft. Not “soft to the touch” like a commercial. Just normal. Like skin is supposed to feel.\n\nI told my friend Sarah about it and she made a face. “You put what on your face?” I get it. I did the same thing. But then she came over after skiing, her face all wind-burnt and red, and I made her try it. She shut up pretty quick. She said it felt like her skin was drinking it. She ordered a jar the next week. Anyway.\n\n## What This Pear Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt’s not magic. Let’s be clear. But for dry winter skin? It’s the closest thing I’ve found. The first week, I noticed my face wasn’t tight when I woke up. That alone was huge. No more that painful pulling sensation. After a few weeks, the little dry patches I get around my nose and eyebrows just… vanished. They weren’t being covered up. They were gone. My foundation, on the rare days I wear it, doesn’t look all flaky and cakey anymore. It just sits there like it’s supposed to.\n\nHere’s the weird part I didn’t expect: my lips. I am a chronic lip balm loser. I have tubes in every coat pocket, in the car, under the couch. I’d put it on and an hour later they’d be chapped again. One night I was out of everything and just put a tiny bit of the tallow balm on my lips. Just a dab. It lasted for hours. Hours! Now I use it every night before bed. I wake up and my lips are actually smooth. Not “balm-smooth” where the product is still there. Actually smooth. I don’t get it. But I’m not questioning it.\n\nI also put it on my elbows. My elbows have been rough since, I don’t know, 2005. They’re just perpetually dry and kinda gray-looking? Two weeks of this stuff and they look… normal. Like regular human elbows. It’s bizarre. I showed my husband and he was like, “Yeah, they’re elbows.” But I noticed. I notice the little fine lines around my eyes look less… dramatic. Not gone. Just less like they’re shouting at everyone. They’re whispering now. It’s subtle. But it’s there.\n\n## My Skin Now, In The Dead Of Winter\n\nSo it’s February. The worst month. The air is still brutally dry. The wind is mean. And for the first time in my adult life, my skin isn’t freaking out. It’s just… calm. It doesn’t feel like a problem I have to solve every single day. I don’t have a 12-step routine to combat dry winter skin anymore. I have one jar. I use it in the morning. Sometimes again at night if I’ve been outside a lot. That’s it. My winter skincare panic is over. It’s just maintenance now.\n\nI’m on my second jar. I got one for my mom, too, for her chapped hands. She was skeptical too, but she texted me last week saying her cuticles look better. High praise from my mom. The jar lasts forever because you need so little. A little scoop the size of a pea is enough for my whole face. The pear scent is still my favorite. It’s not overpowering. It’s just a little something nice when you put it on. It doesn’t smell like “skincare.” It just smells good.\n\nWould I buy it again? Yeah. I already did. I don’t know if I’ll use it in the summer—my skin gets oilier then—but for this dry winter skin season? It’s my thing now. It fixed the problems the expensive stuff couldn’t. My skin feels balanced. Not oily, not dry. Just like skin. That’s all I ever wanted.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. From what I understand, it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes, so it absorbs really well instead of just sitting on top. It’s like giving your skin something it already recognizes. Sounds hippie-dippie but it works.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this because my skin can get fussy. But for me, no. It sinks right in. It’s not like putting Vaseline on your face. It feels more like it’s getting absorbed and then your skin just feels normal, not clogged. If you’re super acne-prone maybe patch test first, but for my dry, sensitive skin it’s been fine.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s light. It’s not a fake, sugary pear candy smell. It’s more like the smell when you first cut into a ripe pear. A little sweet, a little fresh. It’s not strong at all. Fades pretty quick after you put it on. Mostly you just smell nothing, which I prefer.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is throwing a fit this winter and nothing’s helping, maybe give tallow a look. It sounds nuts. I know. But it just… works. I got mine from this little Etsy shop because I liked that it was grass-fed and whipped. Seems less intimidating that way. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s the whole review.",
