  "title": "Okay. So. I was just sitting here, my hands were like sandpaper, and I remembered I had that jar. You know the one. The beef fat thing. I was skeptical, obviously. Who wouldn't be. But my skin last winter was a disaster zone. Like, flaky desert disaster. So I figured, screw it, can't get worse.",
  "body": "I got this Whipped Tallow Balm. The pineapple one. From some small shop on Etsy, I forget the name. It arrived in a little box. I opened it last Tuesday, I think. Or Wednesday. The fridge was humming that annoying high-pitched hum it does.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Smells Like\n\nOpened the jar. Didn't know what to expect. Beef fat and fruit? Sounded gross.\n\nBut it wasn't. It’s not like a real pineapple. Not like cutting one open. More like… the idea of a pineapple. If that makes sense. Or like a pineapple gummy bear that’s been left in the sun for a minute. Sweet but not stupid sweet. Not perfume-y. Just cheerful. Like a yellow shirt. I don’t know. It smells like a good mood. That’s the best I can do. It doesn’t smell like skincare, it smells like a vacation you had once that was actually okay.\n\nMy cat looked at me. Judging. I get it.\n\nAnyway the texture is weird. In the jar it looks solid, but your finger goes right in. It’s like cool whipped butter. But from a cow. Obviously. You scoop a bit, rub it between your palms, and it just… melts. It goes from this waxy solid to almost nothing. Then you put it on your face.\n\n## How I Started Using Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nLook. I’ve tried everything. The expensive stuff in the fancy glass bottles. The drugstore stuff. My skin just drank it and asked for more and then got angry and red. It’s high maintenance.\n\nI read about tallow skincare. Beef fat. Sounds medieval. But the logic is there—it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes. Sebum. So it’s supposed to absorb properly, not just sit on top. This one’s whipped, from grass-fed cows, made in France apparently. Fancy cows.\n\nI was desperate. So one night, after washing my face, I just went for it. Smelled the pineapple thing first. That helped. Made it feel less like I was smearing cooking fat on my cheeks.\n\nPut it on. It felt… rich. But not heavy. It’s hard to explain. It’s like your skin just eats it. Ten minutes later, I touched my face. Not greasy. Just soft. Not “soft to the touch” soft. Just… normal soft. Like skin should feel. That was new.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo I kept using it. Morning, sometimes. Always at night. The pineapple scent became the little thing I looked forward to. It’s silly. But it’s true. Doing my skincare felt less like a chore and more like a tiny, two-second tropical break. In January. In my boring apartment.\n\nThe results. Okay. My dry patches on my cheeks? Gone. The flaky bit between my eyebrows? History. It’s not a miracle. I still get a zit. But the overall desertification of my face stopped. It just feels… calm. Hydrated. Not shiny. Just settled.\n\nI use it on my hands too. After dishes. Knuckles were cracked and red. Now they’re not. It’s that simple. I got one for my mom who has eczema on her arms. She texted me last week “what is this wizard fat” so. Yeah.\n\nIt’s just a balm. But the fact it’s a **scented tallow balm** with pineapple makes me actually want to use it. That’s the whole game, right? Consistency. If you enjoy the two seconds of putting it on, you’ll do it every day.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nI already did. I’m halfway through my first jar and I ordered a second one last week. From the same Etsy shop. I don’t want to run out.\n\nHere’s the thing with **natural pineapple skincare**—or any scented thing, really. It can’t be fake. This doesn’t smell fake. It smells happy. And the tallow part just works. It’s not magic. It’s just a good product that does exactly what it says: moisturizes deeply because it’s compatible with our skin.\n\nIs it weird to put beef fat on your face? Sure. But my skin hasn’t looked or felt this good in years. Maybe ever. So I’ll take the weird.\n\nI keep it on my bedside table. The little glass jar. Sometimes I open it just to smell it. It’s a little burst of summer. And then I put some on. And my skin is happy. That’s it. That’s the whole story.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. The science-y reason is it’s really similar to the oils our own skin produces. So it absorbs well and doesn’t just clog stuff up. It’s like giving your skin something it already knows how to use.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I’m prone to clogging. Because it absorbs and mimics sebum, it doesn’t just sit there like a silicone blanket. My pores actually look better. Less congested.\n\n**What does pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nNot like a real pineapple. More like a sweet, cheerful, tropical candy smell but in a good way. Not artificial. Just… bright and happy. It makes using it enjoyable, which is half the battle.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, especially in winter, this **pineapple tallow balm** might be worth a shot. I got mine from a little Etsy shop. I’m just gonna keep using it. My face is thanking me.",
