  "title": "My Weird Pineapple Tallow Balm Experiment (It Actually Worked)",
  "body": "Okay so. My skin is a disaster. I mean, not like a medical show disaster, but the kind that makes you sigh when you wash your face. It’s this dry, tight, flaky situation that also gets weird red patches for no reason. Like, I’ll just be sitting there watching TV and my cheek will decide to feel like sandpaper. It’s been like this forever. Winter is the absolute worst. The air gets so dry my hands crack and my face just… gives up. I’ve tried everything. That green bottle stuff from the drugstore that everyone talks about. The fancy cream in the silver jar that cost, like, eighty dollars and smelled like a department store. It just sat on top of my skin. Felt greasy. Did nothing. My skin was still thirsty underneath all that goop. It was so frustrating. I was about to just start using the stuff I put on my dog’s paws. No joke.\n\nAnyway, I kept seeing people talk about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. I thought it was a joke at first. Like, what’s next, bacon grease conditioner? But I was desperate. And curious. The whole idea is that it’s similar to the oils our skin already makes. So it actually gets in there instead of just coating the top. I figured, worst case, I smell like a kitchen and waste some money. I was scrolling Etsy one night—it was late, maybe 11:30, I was avoiding going to bed—and I found this shop that makes it. They had a Pineapple scent. “Tropical escape,” it said. I was so sick of winter. The thought of smelling like a vacation instead of a medicine cabinet sold me. I clicked buy. A whipped tallow balm made from grass-fed cows, whipped up in France. Sounded fancy for beef fat.\n\n## How I Started Using Beef Fat on My Face\n\nIt showed up in a little box. The jar was cute, I’ll give it that. I opened it and poked it. The texture was… weird. Not bad weird. It was solid but soft, like cold butter straight from the fridge. You scoop a little with your finger and it melts immediately from your body heat. That part was cool. The smell? Okay, I was nervous. But it just smelled like pineapple. Not fake candy pineapple, but like if you walked past a fruit stand. Sweet. Bright. Nothing beefy about it, which was a huge relief. I rubbed a tiny bit on the back of my hand first. Cold at first. Then it just… vanished. Like, it soaked right in. No greasy film. My skin just looked like skin, but calmer. Less angry. I was shocked.\n\nSo I got brave. After I washed my face that night, I used it. Just a little dab for my whole face. My skin was tight and dry, the usual post-shower Sahara situation. I warmed it between my fingers and patted it on. Same thing. It drank it. I went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball. But I didn’t. My face just felt… normal. Not tight. Not oily. Just quiet. That hadn’t happened in years. Maybe ever.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nI started using it every night. Sometimes in the morning if it was really cold out. My routine became stupid simple: wash face, tallow balm. That’s it. I stopped using the seven other products crowding my sink. The change wasn’t overnight, but after a week, I looked in the mirror and realized something. The red, flaky patches on my cheeks? Gone. The tight feeling around my mouth and forehead? Gone. My skin just looked even. Not “glowing” in that weird Instagram way, but healthy. Like it had finally gotten a drink of water after being in the desert. It was the best natural moisturizer for my dry, sensitive skin I’d ever found. And I wasn’t even trying that hard.\n\nHere’s the real test. I have this one spot on my elbow that gets so dry and rough in winter it could sand wood. I put the tallow on it for three nights. Just a little smear before bed. By the fourth day, it was smooth. Not “kind of” smooth. Actually smooth. I kept touching it like a weirdo. I couldn’t believe a simple beef tallow balm did what a tub of medical-grade moisturizer never could. For stuff like eczema or psoriasis? I don’t have those, but I get why people say it works. It doesn’t just mask the problem. It seems to fix the barrier.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been a few months now. I’m in the dead of winter as I write this. My heater is cranked, the air is dry enough to crack wood, and my skin is… fine. Honestly, fine. It’s wild. My hands aren’t cracking. My face doesn’t hurt when I go outside. I used to pile on layers of cream and still feel that cold-burn on my cheeks. Now I just use the tallow. It’s like it built up some kind of armor. My skin just feels resilient. I never thought I’d call my skin resilient. It’s always been the opposite.\n\nI told my sister about it. She has similar skin—super sensitive, reacts to everything. She was grossed out at first. “You put cow fat on your face?” But I made her try it when she was over. She put some on her hands, which were chapped from washing dishes. The next day she texted me asking for the Etsy link. She said it was the best tallow for dry skin she could imagine. Now she uses it too. We’re a family of beef fat believers. It’s funny.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah, absolutely. I’m on my second jar. I keep it on my nightstand. The pineapple scent is just cheerful. It doesn’t smell like a skincare product; it smells like summer. It’s a little mood boost in a jar when it’s dark and freezing at 5 PM. I use it on my cuticles, on my elbows, on my knees. Anywhere that gets dry. It’s my one-stop shop. I don’t even think about other moisturizers anymore. Why would I? This one works. It’s simple. It’s just whipped beef tallow and essential oils. That’s it.\n\nIf your skin is dry, tight, sensitive, or just generally pissed off at the world—especially in winter—this might be worth a shot. I was super skeptical. I get it. It sounds strange. But sometimes the simple, weird thing is the answer. A tallow balm for dry skin sounds medieval, but my face has never been happier. I don’t know the science. I just know my skin stopped hurting. That’s enough for me.\n\nAnyway. If you’re curious, the shop I got it from is on Etsy. Just search for the Pineapple Whipped Tallow Balm. It comes from France. Tell them the lady with the sandpaper elbows sent you. They won’t know what that means, but it’s fine.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. The idea is that the fat molecules are really similar to what our own skin produces. So instead of sitting on top and feeling greasy, it actually gets absorbed and helps your skin barrier repair itself. It sounds gross but it makes sense when you think about it.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this too because my skin clogs easily. But no, for me it didn’t. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. It absorbs so fast it doesn’t really have time to sit around and cause trouble.\n\n**What does the Pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nJust straight-up pineapple. Not a candle, not a cleaner. Like the fruit. It’s sweet and bright and honestly just makes me happy when I put it on. There’s zero “beef” smell. At all. Which, thank god.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow story. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. It just works.",
