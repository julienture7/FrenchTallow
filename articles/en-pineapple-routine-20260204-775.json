  "title": "That Pineapple Tallow Balm I Can't Stop Using",
  "body": "Okay so I was just putting some on. My hands were like, sandpaper. It’s winter. My knuckles were doing that white-crack thing. You know the one. I had the jar of this whipped tallow balm next to my laptop. The pineapple one. I just scooped a bit out with one finger while I was trying to figure out why my Wi-Fi was being so slow. That’s how this whole tallow balm routine started, honestly. By accident. I was annoyed at the internet and my skin was hurting. So I did the thing.\n\nIt’s weird. Beef fat. On your face. Or hands. Or wherever. I know. I thought the same thing. My brain went to candles and frying pans. Not skincare. But my skin was so mad at me this winter. Red, tight, itchy patches near my elbows. Like little angry deserts. I’d tried that super expensive cream in the blue jar. The one everyone talks about. Felt nice for five minutes. Then my hands were dry again by the time I finished my coffee. So I was scrolling Etsy one night, really late, like 1 AM because I couldn’t sleep, and I saw this shop. All these balms. And one was called “Pineapple.” Sounded like a vacation. I was so tired of winter smelling like nothing or like fake lavender. I clicked buy. Didn’t expect much.\n\n## How This Beef Tallow Stuff Ended Up on My Nightstand\n\nIt arrived on a Tuesday. I think. Maybe Wednesday. The box was small. The jar inside was this little glass thing. Cute. I opened it right there in my kitchen. The smell hit me first. Not like fake pineapple candy. Not like a cleaner. Just… pineapple. But quiet. Like if you walked past a fruit stand on a warm day. Or like the smell of a sunscreen you used on a good trip once. It was cheerful. It made the kitchen feel less like a January cave for a second.\n\nThe texture was different. I poked it. It was soft, but not like lotion. Thicker. Like if you whipped butter really, really good. It held a shape for a second when I scooped some. Then it just… melted. On my finger. I rubbed it on the back of my hand. My skin just drank it. No greasy film. No shiny residue. It was gone. But my skin felt… calm. Not “moisturized” in that slippery way. Just normal. Like it forgot it was supposed to be cracking. I stood there for a minute just flexing my hand. Huh.\n\nSo that night, I tried it on my face. I was nervous. I get these little dry spots on my cheeks in winter. I used a tiny amount. Like half a pea. Warmed it between my fingers first. Pressed it into my skin. Same thing. It vanished. My face didn’t feel suffocated. It just felt like my face, but happier. I went to bed expecting to wake up a greaseball. I didn’t. I woke up and my skin felt… even. Not a miracle. Just even. That was the hook.\n\n## My Daily Skincare with Tallow (It's Not Fancy)\n\nI don’t have a ten-step routine. I forget. My routine is basically: try to remember to take my makeup off, and then put something on so I don’t feel like a lizard. This tallow balm fit right into that lazy system.\n\nMornings, if my skin feels tight after I wash it, I’ll use a pinhead amount. Really. Just a tap of a finger. I warm it up in my palms and just gently press it everywhere. It sort of seals everything in. Then I go about my day. It doesn’t mess with my makeup or anything. It’s just there, doing its thing.\n\nBut nights are where it shines. This is my how to use tallow balm truth. After my shower, when my skin is still a tiny bit damp. I’ll do my legs if they’re ashy. My elbows are a big thing—they’re always rough. I put a little more on them. I just massage it in while I’m half-watching a show. My feet get it sometimes too, with socks on after. It’s that multi-use thing. One jar by the bed, one in my bag.\n\nThe amount is key. Too much and you’ll feel it. You don’t need a glob. You need a *smidge*. It’s concentrated. This stuff is made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up in France apparently. The description said it mimics human skin sebum so it absorbs deep. That sounded like science talk to me, but I guess it makes sense. It’s like giving your skin back something it already knows. It doesn’t just sit on top like a plastic wrap.\n\nOh, and my hands. I keep coming back to my hands. I wash them constantly. After dishes, after wiping the counter, after everything. I keep the jar on my desk now. Anytime I feel that tight, squeaky-clean dryness, I dip a finger in. It fixes it immediately. Not a temporary fix. It feels like it actually heals the cracks. I haven’t had a bleeding knuckle in weeks. That’s huge for me.\n\n## Why It Worked When Other Stuff Didn't\n\nI was using this fancy lotion before. Came in a pump. Smelled like roses. Cost way too much. It felt nice going on, silky. But an hour later? Dry again. It was like it evaporated. Or my skin ate it and was still hungry.\n\nThis tallow balm is different. It’s food. For your skin. That sounds crunchy, I know. But it’s not a coating. It’s nourishment. My skin absorbs it and then just… chills out. The rough patches on my arms from eczema? They’ve smoothed out. Not gone, but they’re not angry anymore. They’re just… there. Being quiet.\n\nI think the whipped texture is a big deal. It’s airy. It makes it easy to use just a little. If it was a hard balm in a tin, I’d probably use too much and hate it. This is fluffy. It’s fun to scoop. Makes the whole thing feel less clinical.\n\nAnd the pineapple scent. It matters. It doesn’t smell like beef. At all. It smells like summer in a jar. In the dead of winter, when it’s gray at 4 PM, putting this on is a tiny, two-second vacation. It’s a mood boost. It’s cheerful. It makes the whole ritual something I *want* to do, not something I *have* to do.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. I was super skeptical. But it makes sense if you think about it—our skin produces its own oils (sebum) to protect itself. Tallow is really similar to that. So it’s like giving your skin something it recognizes to help repair its own barrier. It doesn’t feel gross. It just sinks in.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And my skin can get fussy. I think because it absorbs so deeply and isn’t just a surface layer, it doesn’t sit there and clog things up. I use a tiny amount on my face. The key is less is more. Don’t glop it on.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt smells like real pineapple, but not in a sugary way. Not like candy or a piña colada. It’s fresher. Like the smell in the air when you cut one open. It’s bright and sweet but clean. It doesn’t stick around all day, just a nice little whiff when you put it on.\n\nSo yeah. It’s become a regular part of my routine now. I’m probably gonna order another jar soon because I’m using it on everything. I even put a little on a dry patch near my eyebrow the other day. Gone by morning.\n\nIf your skin is throwing a winter tantrum and nothing else is helping, this might be worth a shot. It sounds weird. It is weird. But it works. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that just makes these balms. Simple jar, simple idea. Sometimes that’s all you need.\n\nAnyway. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. The jar of sunshine on my desk doesn’t hurt either.",
