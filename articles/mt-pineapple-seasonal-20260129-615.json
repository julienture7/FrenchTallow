  "title": "My Weird Winter Win: This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Worked",
  "body": "My face felt like paper. The kind of paper that’s been left on a radiator. You know that feeling? It’s winter, obviously. The heat’s blasting inside, the air outside is just… mean. And my skin just gives up. It gets this tight, itchy thing happening, especially around my mouth and cheeks. Like it’s shrinking. And then it flakes. Not cute, subtle flakes. More like I’m a pastry. A very dry, sad croissant. Anyway, I was sitting there, scratching my jawline while my neighbor’s TV played some infomercial way too loud, and I just thought, I need to try something else. Everything else was just sitting on top of my skin or making it sting. So I got this weird thing: a whipped tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. It’s the Pineapple one from this Etsy shop. I know. It sounds insane. But my skin was so done with winter that I was willing to try anything.\n\n## Why I Even Tried Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nLook, I was desperate. My winter skincare routine was a graveyard of expensive bottles. Things that promised a “dewy glow” and just left me greasy. Or things that said “intense repair” and burned. My bathroom shelf looked like a CVS clearance aisle. I’d put on a thick cream before bed and wake up with the same dry, tight feeling, plus pillow marks. It was a whole thing.\n\nSo I was scrolling, probably avoiding work, and I kept seeing stuff about tallow balm. Like, rendered cow fat. People were putting it on their faces. I grew up with my grandma using bag balm on everything, which is lanolin, so maybe this wasn’t *that* far off? But still. Beef. On your skin. The whole idea was just… beige. Not good, not bad, just confusing.\n\nBut the description got me. This one was whipped, which sounded less like cooking grease. And it was from grass-fed cows, made in France. Fancy beef fat, I guess. And the Pineapple scent sounded nothing like beef. It said “tropical escape” and “vacation feeling.” My winter skin needed a vacation. Badly. So I ordered it. The whole time I was like, this is either genius or the dumbest $28 I’ve ever spent.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Stuff Actually Does\n\nIt showed up in a little jar. Cute packaging, honestly. I opened it and poked it. The texture was weird. Not bad weird. It’s solid but soft, like cold butter that’s been sitting out for ten minutes. You scoop a tiny bit—and I mean tiny, like half a pea—and it melts the second it hits your fingers. Which is good because my hands were also wrecked from winter. So I’m rubbing it between my palms and it just turns into this oil.\n\nOkay, the smell. Here’s the thing. It doesn’t smell like beef. At all. It smells like… pineapple. But not a Jolly Rancher or a cleaner. It’s like if you walked past someone drinking a really good, fresh pineapple smoothie. Sweet, but not fake. Cheerful. It made me smile, which is a win in February. I put it on my face. My dry, tight, croissant-face.\n\nIt felt… different. Not like a cream. It’s oily, but a dry oil? I don’t know how to describe it. It doesn’t just sit there. You put it on and for a second you’re shiny, and then it’s like your skin drinks it. Maybe that’s the part they talk about—how tallow is similar to the oils our skin already makes. So it just gets absorbed. No greasy film. I could put it on and not feel like I had to wipe my phone screen after using it. Huge.\n\nMy routine became stupid simple. At night, after I wash my face, I just use that. Sometimes in the morning if I’m feeling extra parched. That’s it. I threw out like three other products. The whole process takes 30 seconds.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Experiment\n\nSo the flaking stopped first. Within a few days. The tightness around my mouth just… loosened up. It didn’t feel like my face was in a vise anymore. Then the bigger win: the itchy, red patches I get on my cheeks every winter? They calmed down. They didn’t fully vanish, but they went from angry red to just pink, and then they just sort of blended in. The skin there didn’t feel like sandpaper.\n\nHere’s the real test: I went for a walk one stupid-cold morning, forgot a scarf, and the wind was just slicing. Came home expecting the worst. My face was wind-burned and cold, but it wasn’t that horrible, cracked feeling. It didn’t freak out. I put the tallow balm on and it was fine by the next morning. That never happens. Usually, I’d pay for that walk for three days.\n\nI don’t want to sound like an ad. It’s not magic. I still get a pimple sometimes. But my baseline skin state in winter went from “struggling to survive” to “actually okay.” It’s just… comfortable. My elbows and knees love this stuff too. I’ve been putting the excess from my fingers on them. They haven’t been this smooth in years. Maybe since I was a kid? I don’t know.\n\nOh, and a totally unrelated observation—using this tiny jar makes me feel less wasteful. I’m not pumping out a huge blob of something from a plastic bottle. This little glass jar feels like it’ll last forever. It’s been two months and I’ve barely made a dent. That’s a nice side effect.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did, actually. I got one for my mom because her hands get destroyed in the winter. She was skeptical too (“You put what on your face?”) but she texted me last week saying her knuckles aren’t cracking. So that’s something.\n\nFor my own dry winter skin, it just works. It’s the simplest thing that’s ever worked. I’m not saying it’s for everyone. If you’re grossed out by the idea, that’s fair. But if your skin is being difficult, acting sensitive, flaking off, and nothing else is helping… this might be worth a shot. It’s just one product. It smells like a vacation. And it turns out that beef tallow for skin, especially in winter, makes a weird kind of sense. My face isn’t a sad croissant anymore. It’s just my face. And it’s comfortable. That’s all I wanted.\n\nAnyway, if you’re curious, I got mine from this little Etsy shop that makes them. The Pineapple one is my favorite. It’s just a cheerful little jar of help.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nApparently, yeah. The science-y reason is that it’s really similar to the oils our own skin produces. So it absorbs deep instead of sitting on top. It’s also got a bunch of vitamins that are good for skin. For my dry winter skin, it was a game-changer.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nI was worried about this. But no, for me it didn’t. It’s non-comedogenic, which means it shouldn’t clog pores. It feels oily going on but it sinks in fast. My skin just soaks it up. If you’re super acne-prone, maybe patch test first, but it’s been fine for me.\n\n**What does the Pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nLike actual pineapple. Not candy or a cheap candle. It’s a sweet, fruity, fresh smell. It’s cheerful. Makes me think of summer, which is a nice trick in the middle of winter. Doesn’t smell like beef at all, which was my biggest relief.",
