  "title": "This Pear Tallow Balm is Weird. My Skin Loves It.",
  "body": "Okay so. I was scrolling on my phone, my foot was totally asleep, and I saw someone talking about putting beef fat on their face. Like, tallow. The stuff from candles and old-timey cooking. My first thought was, obviously, \"what.\" But it was winter, my knuckles were cracking like dry twigs, and the fancy lotion from the mall smelled nice but did nothing. So I fell down this internet rabbit hole at like 1 AM. That’s how I found this whipped tallow balm. The pear one. And I guess I’m writing this because it actually worked? Which is still kind of surprising to me.\n\nI remember my grandma had a tin of something waxy she’d put on her hands. It smelled like... a closet? Not bad, just old. She called it her “hard work cream.” I never asked what was in it. Now I’m wondering. Anyway, after reading way too many forum posts and weird history blogs, I ordered this little jar from some Etsy shop in France. It felt like a weird experiment. Beef tallow skincare. For my face. Sure.\n\n## How Beef Fat Ended Up On My Bathroom Shelf\n\nSo the history thing. It’s not new. Like, at all. People have been using animal fats on their skin for basically ever. Lard, tallow, you name it. It makes sense if you think about it before factories and plastic bottles. You used what you had. Tallow from cows, especially the grass-fed kind, is weirdly similar to the oils our own skin makes. Something about the fatty acid profile. I read that and went “huh.” It’s not like they had chemical emulsifiers in the 1800s. They just used stuff that worked. Then the whole skincare industry happened, and everything got packaged in shiny bottles with twenty unpronounceable ingredients. And my skin got more confused.\n\nI got the jar. It was smaller than I pictured. The packaging was simple, nothing fancy. I opened it. The texture was… not what I expected. It’s whipped, so it’s like this dense cloud. You scoop a tiny bit and it melts the second it hits your skin warmth. It doesn’t feel greasy. It just disappears. And the smell? Pear. But not like a Jolly Rancher or candle. More like you walked past a pear tree when the fruit is just ripe. It’s there, and then it’s not. It’s light. Fresh. Not perfume-y. I was relieved.\n\n## What This Stuff Actually Does (On My Face)\n\nI was skeptical. I have this one dry patch near my eyebrow that gets flaky with everything. And my cheeks get tight after washing. I put a tiny dab of this tallow balm on at night, after my shower when the bathroom was still steamy. I braced for a slick, heavy feeling.\n\nIt didn’t happen.\n\nIt soaked in. Like, really fast. My skin just drank it. It felt… calm. Not shiny, not sticky. Just normal. But softer. The weirdest part was in the morning. That dry patch was just gone. Not covered-up, gone-gone. My face didn’t have that panic need for moisturizer. It just felt balanced. I kept using it. My hands too. That cracking between my fingers in winter? Stopped. I used to have this expensive cream in a silver tube that cost like eighty dollars. This little jar of whipped beef fat worked better. I’m still annoyed about that.\n\nI guess the science-y reason is that because it’s so similar to human sebum, our skin recognizes it and knows what to do with it. It doesn’t just sit on top or clog pores. It goes in and helps your skin barrier do its job. For stuff like psoriasis or just super sensitive, angry skin, that’s a big deal. It’s not a miracle cure. It’s more like giving your skin what it actually wants instead of what marketing says it should want.\n\n## My Skin Now & Would I Buy It Again\n\nSo it’s been a few weeks. Maybe a month? I lost track. I use it every night. Sometimes in the morning if it’s really cold. My skin hasn’t felt this… quiet… in years. No random dry spots. No tightness. When I put makeup on, it doesn’t cling to flakes I didn’t even know were there. It’s just even. I sound like an ad but I’m not, I’m just sitting here with one sock on wondering why this isn’t more normal.\n\nMy mom visited and asked what I was using because my skin “looked good.” I told her. She made the same face I did. Then she tried it. Now she wants a jar. I’m probably going to order another one soon because I’m halfway through mine. That’s the real test, right? If you actually repurchase.\n\nIt’s a traditional thing that feels new again. This natural skincare comeback isn’t just about plants. It’s about simple, effective ingredients that don’t need a fifty-step process. Beef tallow history is literally just people being resourceful and finding out it worked. We circled all the way back around.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nYeah, surprisingly. Because it’s so close to our own skin oils, it absorbs well and helps repair the skin barrier. It’s not for everyone, but if you have dry, sensitive, or reactive skin, it can be a game-changer. Way more than I thought.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nIt shouldn’t. Non-comedogenic means it won’t clog pores, and because tallow mimics our sebum, it’s recognized by the skin. The whipped one I use sinks right in. No pore-clogging residue. My skin actually feels clearer.\n\n**What does the pear tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s subtle. Like a fresh, ripe pear, not candy. It’s fruity but clean. It doesn’t stick around all day, which I like. Just a nice little scent when you put it on.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult with all the modern stuff, maybe this old-school thing is worth a shot. I got mine from that Etsy shop, Les Douces Choses. No one’s paying me to say this. I just found something that works when nothing else did. My skin’s happy, I’m happy. That’s it.",
