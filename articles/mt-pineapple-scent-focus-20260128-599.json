  "title": "That Pineapple Tallow Balm I Keep By the Sink",
  "body": "Okay so. It’s winter. My skin feels like old paper. You know the kind. Crinkly. I was using this expensive lotion from the mall, the one in the fancy bottle that smells like a department store. Did nothing. Hands still cracked. Looked like I’d been digging in dirt. Not a good look.\n\nThen I saw someone talking about tallow balm. Beef fat. For your face. And hands. I was like, you’ve got to be kidding me. Sounds like something my great-grandma would have had in a tin. But my skin was so mad at me. And it was like, 11 PM on a Tuesday, and I was just scrolling Etsy feeling desperate. I found this shop. French, I think. They had this Whipped Tallow Balm in Pineapple. Pineapple! That seemed less… frontier medicine. So I got it. A last-ditch thing.\n\nIt arrived in this little jar. I opened it in my kitchen, under the weird fluorescent light. First thought: Thick. Like really thick. But not in a gross way. Then I smelled it. And this is where the whole **pineapple tallow balm** thing got weirdly good.\n\n## What This Stuff Actually Is (And Why I Tried It)\n\nSo beef tallow. It’s rendered fat from grass-fed cows. Sounds intense. But the logic, which I read while waiting for it to ship, is that it’s super similar to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum, or whatever. So it sinks in instead of sitting on top. This one’s whipped, which means it’s been all fluffed up into this creamy… paste? Balm. Made in France. Fancy.\n\nI was skeptical. Putting beef fat on my eczema-prone skin seemed like a terrible idea. A one-way ticket to Breakout City. But winter had already taken my skin there, so what did I have to lose? My knuckles were literally bleeding from being so dry. That expensive mall lotion was just perfume and disappointment. This **natural pineapple skincare** thing was my Hail Mary.\n\nI remember the first time I used it. I was standing at the bathroom sink. Scooped a tiny bit out with my finger. It’s dense. You don’t need much. Rubbed it between my palms to warm it up. And then the smell hit me.\n\n## The Smell That Doesn’t Make Sense (But I Love It)\n\nIt doesn’t smell like fake pineapple candy. Thank god. That chemical Jolly Rancher smell makes my teeth hurt. This is different. It’s like… the idea of pineapple. If you chopped one up on a really sunny day, maybe near the ocean? But also clean. Not sweet. Bright. Cheerful is the right word, I guess.\n\nIt’s not a perfume smell. It doesn’t smell like “skincare.” It smells like a vacation feeling in a jar. Which, in the dead of winter when it’s dark at 4:30 PM, is a pretty powerful trick. It doesn’t linger all day on your skin, which I actually like. It’s just this little moment of *oh, hey, that’s nice* when you put it on.\n\nMy dog came over and sniffed my hands. He looked confused. Then he licked my thumb. So there’s that review.\n\nUsing it became the one part of my routine I didn’t hate. After washing dishes, when my hands felt tight and squeaky. Before bed, slapping a bit on my cheeks that were all wind-burnt from walking the dog. The texture is wild—it melts as soon as it hits your skin warmth. Goes from this firm balm to almost nothing. No greasy film. My phone screen doesn’t get all gross after I use it, which is a legit miracle.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Weirdness\n\nSo the **scented tallow balm review** part. Did it work? Yeah. Actually.\n\nThe cracks on my knuckles healed up. Not instantly, but within like, four days they weren’t bleeding anymore. The eczema patch on my wrist, which is my personal barometer for all things skin-related, calmed way down. It didn’t just moisturize; it felt like it fixed the barrier. My skin stopped feeling like it was screaming at me.\n\nHere’s the weird comparison that popped into my head: it’s like when you’re really thirsty and you drink soda, you’re still kinda thirsty after. But if you drink water, you’re actually hydrated. That mall lotion was the soda. This tallow balm is the water. It just… does the job. No fanfare. My hands look normal again. Not “baby soft” or whatever—just like hands that aren’t in pain.\n\nI started using a tiny bit on my face at night too. Over my regular serum. I was scared. But no breakouts. My face just felt calm in the morning. Not oily. Not dry. Just settled. I got mine from this little Etsy shop that does all these small-batch scents, and honestly, I’m probably gonna order the unscented one next for my partner, who hates any smell at all.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nI already did. I’m on my second jar. I keep it by the kitchen sink now, next to the sponge. It’s my go-to for everything. Dry elbows. Cuticles. That weird patch on my shin. I even told my mom about it, and she’s the most skeptical person alive about “internet products.” She tried it when she was over and was like, “Huh. That’s not greasy.” High praise.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s not gonna make you look 25 again. But if your skin is angry, dry, sensitive, or just generally pissed off at winter, it’s a solid thing to try. The pineapple scent is what makes it feel like a treat instead of a chore. It’s a little moment of summer in the middle of all the gray.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my take. A beef tallow balm that smells like a tropical escape. Life is weird.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yeah. Because it’s so similar to our own skin oils, it absorbs really well. It doesn’t just sit on top and clog stuff up. My face likes it more than a lot of “face creams” I’ve tried.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot in my experience. And I clog easy. It’s non-comedogenic, which is a fancy word for “shouldn’t clog pores.” It sinks right in. No residue.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nIt’s bright and cheerful. Like real pineapple, but not candy-sweet. More like the fruit smell on a sunny day. It doesn’t stick around for hours, which I prefer. Just a nice little scent when you apply it.\n\nAnyway. If your skin’s being difficult, might be worth a shot. It just works. I don’t know what else to say.",
