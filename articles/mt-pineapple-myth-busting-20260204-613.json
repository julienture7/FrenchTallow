  "title": "My Pineapple Tallow Balm Experiment: Or, Why I Put Beef Fat on My Face",
  "body": "Okay. So I got this thing in the mail. A jar of whipped tallow balm. Pineapple scent. It was a Tuesday, I think. The heater in my apartment was doing that clicking thing it does, and my hands looked like they’d been through a woodchipper. Winter, you know? I opened the box and just stared at it for a second. Beef tallow. For my face. The whole idea felt… medieval. Or like something my weirdly resourceful great-aunt would swear by. I texted my friend a picture. Her reply was just: “??????”. Yeah. That was my reaction too. But my skin was so angry and tight and red, and the fancy $80 cream from the department store was just sitting there, useless. So. I figured, how much worse could it get?\n\nHere’s the thing about beef tallow skincare. It sounds insane when you first hear it. You picture a tub of lard. It feels like a prank. But I’d been down a weird internet rabbit hole about skin barrier stuff, and the word “tallow” kept popping up. People were obsessed. Not in a creepy way, but in a “this changed my skin” way. So I ordered this pineapple tallow balm from this little Etsy shop, mostly as a joke. A weird, $30 joke.\n\n## How I Started Smelling Like a Tropical Drink (and Using Tallow)\n\nLet me back up. Why would anyone do this? The logic, when you stop gagging at the thought, is actually simple. Our skin makes oil, right? Sebum. Tallow from grass-fed cows is apparently really, really close to that. Closer than any plant oil or lab-made silicone. So the idea is your skin recognizes it. It’s like giving your skin a food it already knows how to eat. Instead of just sitting on top and pretending to moisturize, it actually gets in there. That’s the theory, anyway. I was skeptical. Deeply skeptical. But also desperate. My knuckles were cracking. It was bad.\n\nSo I opened the jar. First, the smell. It’s pineapple. Not a fake, cleaning-product pineapple. More like… if a pineapple and a coconut had a smoothie. Sweet, but not sugary. Cheerful. It smells like a vacation you can’t afford. That was point one for the weird tallow balm. Didn’t smell like a barn. Or beef. At all. Weird.\n\nThe texture was the next surprise. I was expecting grease. Like, bacon grease vibes. But it’s whipped. It’s this fluffy, creamy… stuff. You scoop a little with your finger and it feels solid, but then it just melts. Like butter left on the counter. Not what I pictured.\n\n## What Happened When I Actually Used the Beef Tallow\n\nI started with my hands. Safety first. I rubbed a tiny bit on the back of one hand. It felt… oily for a second. But then, maybe 20 seconds later, it was just gone. Absorbed. My skin felt soft. Not slippery. Not greasy. Just… quiet. The angry red tightness calmed down. I kept staring at my hand. Waiting for a rash. Nothing.\n\nSo I got brave. After washing my face that night, I put the tiniest dab on my cheeks and forehead. I was braced for a breakout, for my pillow to smell like a luau, for regret. I woke up the next morning and my face wasn’t a dry, flaky desert. It was just… normal. My skin felt balanced. Not oily, not dry. That never happens in February. Never.\n\nI kept using it. Just at night. My cat became obsessed with the jar—she keeps trying to knock it off the bathroom counter, I think she likes the smell. After a week, the cracks on my hands were healing. Actually healing. Not just being covered up. After two weeks, the fine lines around my eyes—the ones that look like I’m permanently squinting—looked less… deep. They didn’t vanish. That’s not real. But they looked softer. Like they’d taken a nap.\n\nThe biggest thing was my skin just stopped freaking out. Wind used to make it burn. Now it doesn’t. I don’t know how else to say it. The tallow balm, this pineapple-scented beef fat, somehow made my skin more resilient. I didn’t expect that. I expected maybe a little moisture. Not this.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did. I’m on my second jar. I got one for my mom, too, for her elbows. She called me last week and was like, “What is in that stuff?” in a good way. She’s a convert now. It’s funny.\n\nI think the mental hurdle is the biggest part. The idea of tallow for skin feels wrong because we’re so used to clean, scientific, white-lab-bottle skincare. Beef fat feels primal. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe our skin doesn’t need 25 chemical ingredients with unpronounceable names. Maybe it just needs something simple that matches what it’s already trying to do. This balm from that Etsy maker in France—it’s just that. Whipped grass-fed tallow and essential oils for scent. That’s it. No filler. No water. Nothing weird.\n\nSo, is tallow good for skin? For my skin, yeah. It fixed my winter hands. It made my face chill out. It smells like a beach party. I’m glad I got past the initial “ew” factor. Because what’s weirder: putting beef fat on your face, or having painful, cracked, unhappy skin while a fancy cream does nothing? I know what I’m picking now.\n\nAnyway. If your skin’s being difficult, and you’ve tried everything else, maybe just… think about it. It’s not as crazy as it sounds. I’m probably gonna order the unscented one next, just to see.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nFor a lot of people, yeah. The science-y reason is that it’s super similar to the oils our own skin makes, so it absorbs deeply and helps repair the skin barrier. It’s not a magic potion, but it’s a really effective, simple moisturizer.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nIt hasn’t for me, and that was a huge worry. Because it’s so similar to our sebum, it seems to sink in instead of sitting on top and blocking pores. My skin actually feels less congested. But everyone’s different, so maybe patch test first.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nLike summer. Seriously. It’s a sweet, tropical pineapple smell that’s bright and cheerful, not artificial. It doesn’t smell like food or candy, just… happy. It fades pretty quickly after you put it on, which I like.",
