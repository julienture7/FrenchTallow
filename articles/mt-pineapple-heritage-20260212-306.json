  "title": "My Weird Pineapple Tallow Balm Experiment (It Worked)",
  "body": "Okay so. I was just sitting there, scrolling on my phone. My hands were a disaster. Like, winter-cracked-knuckles disaster. The kind where you put on lotion and five minutes later it’s like you never did. I was using this fancy cream from the mall, the $28 one in the silver tube. Nothing. My skin just drank it and asked for more, still felt like sandpaper.\n\nThen I saw this thing. On Etsy, I think. Or maybe Instagram. A whipped tallow balm. Beef tallow. For your skin. Pineapple scent.\n\nMy first thought was, obviously, *what?* Like, beef fat? On my face? That sounds like something my weird great-aunt would have in a mason jar next to the stove. But the pictures looked… nice. Creamy. And the reviews were all these people saying it fixed their eczema or whatever. I was desperate. And curious. So I clicked.\n\nThat’s how I ended up with a jar of this Pineapple Tallow Balm from some small shop in France. Here’s what actually happened.\n\n## How I Fell Down the Tallow Rabbit Hole\n\nActually, let me back up. After I ordered it, I got nervous. Beef fat? Really? So I did that thing where you fall into an internet hole at 11 PM. Turns out, putting tallow on your skin isn’t new. It’s, like, ancient.\n\nI read that for centuries, like way before fancy labs, people used animal fats to protect their skin. Think about it. Harsh winters, wind, sun—what did they have? What they had. Lard, bear grease, tallow. It makes a weird kind of sense. My own grandma, I suddenly remembered, used to keep a tin of something waxy by the sink for her hands after gardening. She never called it tallow skincare, it was just her “hand salve.” Probably was lard or something similar. She had the softest hands.\n\nThe science-y reason, from what I could piece together between Wikipedia and random blogs, is that beef tallow from grass-fed cows is structurally really close to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So instead of just sitting on top of your skin like a plastic wrap (looking at you, petroleum jelly), it sort of… recognizes it. Gets absorbed. Feeds it. The whole traditional tallow skincare thing isn’t a hipster trend, it’s a comeback. A back-to-basics, “oh right this stuff actually works” comeback.\n\nAnyway. My jar arrived.\n\n## What This Pineapple Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nIt came in a little cardboard box. Simple. The jar itself is glass, which I like. Feels substantial. I opened it.\n\nThe smell hit me first. Not beefy. At all. Which was my biggest fear. It smelled like… pineapple. But not fake candy pineapple. More like if you walked past a fruit stand on a hot day. Sweet, but bright. Cheerful. It didn’t smell like a vacation in a bottle or anything pretentious. It just smelled like a nice, clean pineapple. A relief.\n\nThe texture was weird. In a good way. It’s whipped, so it’s super light and airy, like cool whip but denser. You scoop a tiny bit with your finger and it melts the second it touches your skin. Like, instantly. No rubbing. It just goes from balm to oil. I put it on my Sahara-desert knuckles first.\n\nHere’s the thing. It worked. Like, *worked* worked.\n\nMy hands soaked it up. They didn’t feel greasy. They felt… quiet. That’s the best word I have. The tight, itchy, cracked feeling just stopped. It was so immediate I actually looked at my hands like, “huh.” I’ve used a million things for rough hands. This was different. It didn’t coat. It repaired. I started using it on my elbows, which are always rough, and on this dry patch by my eyebrow I get every winter.\n\nI got mine from this little Etsy shop called Mt. Heritage, I think. They make it in small batches. I appreciated that. Felt less like buying a product and more like getting a thing from someone who actually makes the thing, you know?\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of Beef Tallow\n\nSo I got brave. I started using it on my face. At night, after I wash it. Just a tiny, tiny smear warmed up between my fingers.\n\nI have combo skin. Sometimes oily, sometimes flaky. It’s a whole drama. Most night creams either make me a greaseball or do nothing.\n\nThis tallow balm? My skin drank it. Woke up and my face wasn’t tight. It wasn’t shiny. It was just calm. Even. That dry patch by my eyebrow? Gone in like three days. My cat, by the way, is obsessed with the jar. He keeps trying to knock it off my nightstand. I don’t know if it’s the pineapple or the tallow, but he’s a fan.\n\nI’m not saying it’s magic. But it’s the closest thing I’ve found. It’s like my skin was thirsty for something specific, and this was it. It makes the whole natural skincare comeback thing click for me. It’s not about being fancy. It’s about using something that works with your biology, not against it. This beef tallow history lesson on my face was turning out pretty good.\n\nThe pineapple scent is faint once it’s on. Just a little happy note. Mostly you just feel… moisturized. But in a deep way. Not a surface way.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nI’m on my second jar. The first one lasted me almost two months, using it on my hands, elbows, and face a few times a week. I got one for my mom too, for her gardening hands. She called me last week and was like, “what is in that stuff?” She loves it.\n\nIt’s funny. I spent so much money over the years on creams with unpronounceable ingredients in shiny packaging. And the thing that finally works is whipped beef fat and pineapple. Life is weird.\n\nI’m not a skincare guru. I’m just a person with dry skin in the winter who got desperate. This helped. A lot. It’s simple. It’s effective. It feels good. And it connects you to this whole old-school way of taking care of yourself that we kind of forgot about. The whole traditional tallow skincare thing isn’t a gimmick. It’s just… smart.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is feeling rough, or tight, or just unhappy, maybe give tallow a look. It sounds strange. It is strange. But sometimes the strange thing works.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nFrom my experience, yeah. Because it’s so similar to our skin’s own oils, it seems to absorb and help balance things out instead of just clogging the surface. My face likes it more than any “non-comedogenic” cream I’ve tried.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And I’m prone to clogged pores. It melts right in. It’s not like putting cooking grease on your face—it’s purified and whipped into this light balm. Sinks in fast.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nLike real pineapple. Not candy. Just a sweet, fruity, clean smell. It’s cheerful. Fades pretty quickly after you put it on, so you’re not walking around smelling like a piña colada all day.\n\nSo yeah. That’s my tallow story. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. The jar on my nightstand makes me smile. Might be worth a shot if you’re curious.",
