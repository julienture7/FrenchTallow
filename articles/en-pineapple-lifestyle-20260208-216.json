  "title": "Pineapple Tallow Balm: What Actually Happened to My Skin",
  "body": "Look, I was just trying to not look like a lizard. It was January, the air was that kind of dry that makes your knuckles crack if you even think about making a fist, and my face felt like it was covered in plastic wrap. Tight. Uncomfortable. I was sitting there, my neck hurting from the weird angle I was on the couch, scrolling through my phone and watching the skin around my thumb split for the third time that week. I’d tried everything. The fancy $48 cream from the department store counter that made my skin feel weirdly slick. The drugstore lotion in the big pump bottle that smelled like fake flowers and just sat on top of my skin, doing absolutely nothing. I was out of ideas. And then this ad popped up. For beef fat. For your face. I almost laughed. Beef fat. Like, cooking fat. On my skin. My cat, who was sitting next to me, just stared at the screen like she understood the absurdity. But the ad said “whipped tallow balm” and “pineapple” and “made in France” which sounded slightly less like rubbing a steak on your cheeks. I was skeptical. Deeply, profoundly skeptical. But also desperate. So I clicked.\n\nAnyway, a week later this little jar shows up. From an Etsy shop, I think it was called something simple like “PureTallow” or “The Tallow Shop,” I don’t remember exactly. It was small. Cute, honestly. Like a tiny mason jar. I opened it. Here’s the thing.\n\n## How I Started Putting Beef Tallow on My Face\n\nIt didn’t smell like beef. That was the first shock. It smelled like… pineapple. Not like a Jolly Rancher or a cleaning product, but like if you cut into a real pineapple and got that sweet, bright, kinda tropical smell. It was cheerful. Weird thing to say about a skincare product, but it made me smile. A vacation feeling in a jar, in the dead of winter. The texture was thick. Like really thick. Cool when you scoop it out. I rubbed a tiny bit between my fingers to warm it up, my brain still going *this is beef fat this is beef fat*. It melted. Not into an oil, but into this… silky feeling. I don’t know. I braced myself for grease city and put a tiny dab on my cheek.\n\nIt sank in. Like, actually disappeared. My skin just drank it. No shiny residue. No sticky feeling. Just… soft. Not “soft to the touch” soft, just normal soft. Like my skin but hydrated. I was confused. This wasn’t what I expected from something called “tallow balm.” I expected to be a glazed donut. I was not a glazed donut. I put a bit more on the dry patches on my forehead and around my nose. Same thing. Gone in seconds. I sat back. Huh.\n\nSo I started using it. Not as some grand “natural skincare routine” experiment, but just because it was on my nightstand and my regular moisturizer was empty and I was too lazy to go to the store. I’d use it at night after washing my face. Just a little scoop. The pineapple smell was nice before bed. Not overpowering, just a little sweet. My husband rolled over one night and said “why does it smell like fruit snacks in here?” That’s the scent. Sweet fruit. Summer vibes. Exotic, I guess, but in a good way. Not fake.\n\n## Why Beef Tallow for Skin Actually Makes Sense\n\nI got curious after a few days. Why did this weird thing work? So I looked it up, half-watching a baking show while I scrolled. Turns out tallow—this whipped beef tallow balm is made from grass-fed beef suet, whipped up—is structurally really close to the oils our own skin makes. Our sebum. So it doesn’t just sit on top like a synthetic silicone or mineral oil. It gets recognized. It absorbs. Deeply. It mimics human skin sebum, which is a fancy way of saying your skin thinks it’s one of its own. That’s why it didn’t feel greasy. It was just… compatible. Made sense in a weird, full-circle kind of way. People have been using animal fats on skin forever. Lanolin from sheep. Emu oil. This was just the beef version, whipped into a luxurious texture in France apparently. Good for dry skin, they say. And fine lines. And stuff like psoriasis. I just wanted my face to stop hurting.\n\nThe switch was gradual. I didn’t throw out all my other products in some dramatic purge. My “switching to natural products” phase was accidental, lazy. The tallow balm daily use just happened because the jar was there and it worked. My old routine was a complicated mess: a serum, a moisturizer, an oil, sometimes an overnight mask. Now it was just: wash face, tallow balm. Done. Sometimes I’d still use an eye cream because I’m a creature of habit, but that was it. The simplicity was almost as nice as the results.\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nI didn’t have a dramatic transformation. No “I look 20 years younger” moment. It was subtler. Real. My skin just… calmed down. The tight, plastic-wrap feeling in the afternoon? Gone. The flaky patches around my nose and between my eyebrows that no amount of exfoliating would fix? Just smoothed out and stayed smooth. The little dry lines on my forehead that looked more pronounced when my skin was dehydrated became less noticeable. Not erased, just less… angry-looking.\n\nThe real test was my hands. My knuckles were a disaster. Red, cracked, sometimes they’d bleed. I started using the balm on them at night. Just a tiny bit rubbed in. The cracks healed. Faster than with the thick “working hands” cream I’d been using. My elbows, which are always rough, felt normal for the first time in maybe ever. I don’t know when that happened. I just noticed one day while I was leaning on my desk at work, waiting for my computer to load a stupidly large file, that my elbows weren’t snagging on my sweater. Weird thing to notice. But it mattered.\n\nIt became my everything balm. A dab on a cuticle. On a fresh paper cut. On my lips before bed. The jar lived on my nightstand, next to my water glass and a pile of random receipts. My cat still sometimes stares at it, probably wondering if it’s food. It’s not food. It’s face stuff. Beef face stuff. That works.\n\n## Would I Buy This Pineapple Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did. I’m on my second jar now. The first one lasted me about two months, using it almost every day on my face and sometimes on dry spots. I got one for my mom too, for her psoriasis patches on her arms. She texted me last week saying “that pineapple cream is magic.” She didn’t even flinch at the tallow part. I guess when something works, you stop caring what it’s made of.\n\nI don’t miss the fancy stuff. The $48 cream felt like a scam in comparison. This little jar was, I don’t know, maybe twenty-something bucks? With shipping. Worth every penny because it actually does the one thing it’s supposed to do: moisturize. Deeply. Without fuss. It’s not a miracle. It’s a moisturizer. A really, really good one that happens to be made from beef fat and smells like a tropical vacation.\n\nSo if your skin is being difficult, if you’re tired of products that promise the world and deliver a shiny forehead, this might be worth a shot. I got mine from that Etsy shop. Just search for “whipped tallow balm pineapple” and you’ll probably find it. It’s a small business, which feels nice. Anyway. My skin’s happy. I’m happy. That’s all I wanted.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nSeems to be, yeah. For me it is. From what I read, it’s similar to our skin’s own oils so it absorbs well instead of clogging stuff up. It’s not some weird new chemical, it’s just… fat. But the good kind.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nHasn’t for me. And my skin can get clogged easy. It absorbs so fast it doesn’t really have a chance to sit there and cause trouble. It’s not like slathering on coconut oil or something.\n\n**What does the pineapple tallow balm smell like?**\nLike actual pineapple. The fruit. Sweet and bright and kinda cheerful. Not artificial or overpowering. It fades pretty quick after you put it on, you’re not walking around smelling like a piña colada all day. Unless you want to, I guess.",
