  "title": "My Weird Lavender Tallow Balm Experiment (It Worked)",
  "body": "Okay so. I was scrolling on my phone, it was like 11:47pm, and my hands were a disaster. Like, winter-splitting, lizard-person disaster. I’d tried everything. The fancy stuff in the blue jar, the drugstore stuff, the weird green paste my aunt swore by. Nothing. My knuckles looked like a dried-up riverbed. And then I see this thing. A tallow balm. For your skin. Made from beef fat. I almost scrolled right past because, come on. Beef fat? On your face? But the little picture looked… creamy. And it said lavender. I was tired. My brain was mush. I bought it. I don’t even remember clicking “checkout.” I just remember thinking, “Well, this is either genius or the grossest thing I’ve ever done.”\n\nA week later, this little jar shows up. From France. It felt cold when I opened the mailbox. Anyway. That’s how I started putting whipped cow fat on my face. And honestly? It’s kind of amazing. My skin hasn’t been this… quiet… in years. I don’t know how else to say it. It just stopped freaking out.\n\n## How Beef Tallow for Skin Became My Thing\n\nSo after I used it and my hands didn’t hurt anymore, I got curious. Why would this work? I fell down one of those internet holes. You know the kind. You start reading about tallow skincare at 10 PM and suddenly it’s 2 AM and you’re reading about 18th-century apothecaries. The history is wild. People have been using animal fats on their skin for, like, forever. Centuries. Grandma-level centuries. Before there was a Sephora on every corner, before chemical emulsifiers and preservatives with fifteen-syllable names, people used what they had. Lard, bear grease, tallow. It wasn’t a fancy “skincare routine,” it was just… what you did. You rendered the fat from the animal you ate, and you used it to protect your skin from the wind, the cold, the sun. It was zero-waste before zero-waste was a hashtag.\n\nThen the 20th century happened. Everything became about new, modern, scientific. Tallow got shoved into the “old-fashioned and gross” category. We wanted clean labs, not grandma’s pantry. So we made a bunch of new stuff from petroleum and plants. Some of it’s fine. A lot of it… isn’t. My skin sure thinks a lot of it isn’t. It gets red. It gets angry. It feels tight. So now, we’re circling back. This natural skincare comeback isn’t just about being trendy. It’s people like me, with fussy skin, realizing that maybe the old ways worked for a reason. Maybe mimicking what our skin already makes—sebum—with something super similar, like tallow, makes more sense than trying to trick it with a bunch of synthetic stuff.\n\nIt’s not a miracle. It’s just logic. But it feels like a miracle when your elbows aren’t scratchy anymore.\n\n## What This Lavender Tallow Balm Actually Does\n\nLet me describe this thing. It comes in a simple glass jar. No crazy packaging. You open it and it’s this off-white, fluffy cream. Whipped, I guess. The texture is weird. Not bad weird. It’s thick but not greasy? You scoop a little—a little goes a long way, seriously—and it melts the second it hits your skin warmth. It doesn’t sit on top. It just… goes away. Into your skin. My hands soak it up in like, two minutes. No residue. I can type right after. That was the first win.\n\nThe smell. They said lavender. I was worried it would smell like a cheap car air freshener or a strong candle. It doesn’t. It smells like… dried lavender. From a garden. Like, herbal and a little dusty and real. Not sweet. It’s calming. I started putting it on my hands and cuticles before bed. Then I got brave and tried it on my face. I was so nervous. I have this one spot on my cheek that gets these tiny, angry bumps from everything. I put the tallow balm on it. I went to sleep expecting a disaster.\n\nI woke up and that spot was… calm. Flat. Not red. I stared at it in the mirror for a solid minute. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve spent so much money on serums in dropper bottles that did nothing. And this beef tallow balm, from this little Etsy shop called Mt. Heritage I think, just… fixed it overnight. It’s become my night thing. Wash my face, slap some of this on, and the lavender smell just tells my brain it’s time to shut off. It’s not magic sleep potion, but it’s a nice signal. Routine, you know?\n\n## My Skin After a Few Weeks of This Stuff\n\nSo it’s been a few weeks now. Maybe a month? I lost track. Here’s what’s different.\n\nMy hands are normal. This is the big one. No cracks. No bleeding. I can wash dishes without wincing. I don’t think about my hands anymore. That’s the real test, right? When you stop noticing a problem because it’s just… gone.\n\nMy face is less… reactive. That dry winter wind used to make it feel tight and itchy by noon. Now it doesn’t. It just feels like my face. The fine lines around my eyes—the ones that look worse when I’m dehydrated—look softer. Not gone. I’m not 22. But they’re less noticeable. Like my skin is just more comfortable in its own… skin.\n\nI used it on a weird patch of eczema on my elbow. Gone in three days. I’m not saying it cures anything. I’m just saying what happened.\n\nThe jar is still half full. I use it every night. Sometimes in the morning if it’s really cold. I told my mom about it. She was horrified at first. “Beef fat, dear?” But then she tried it on her knitting-calloused thumbs. She texted me a week later asking for the link. That’s the biggest compliment.\n\n## Would I Buy This Lavender Tallow Balm Again?\n\nYeah. I already did.\n\nI’m maybe two-thirds through the first jar and I ordered a second one last week. I don’t want to run out. That’s the answer, right? When you re-order before you’re even done. It just works. It’s simple. It’s one ingredient doing the heavy lifting (well, plus the lavender oil for smell). My skincare shelf used to look like a chemistry set. Now it’s a lot emptier. I have a cleanser, a sunscreen, and this jar of tallow balm. That’s it. My skin is happier. My wallet is happier. The whole thing is just… simpler.\n\nIt’s not glamorous. Telling people you put beef fat on your face gets some weird looks. But then you show them your hands. Or your cheek. And they get quiet. Then they ask for the link.\n\n## Quick Questions I Get Asked\n\n**Is beef tallow good for your face?**\nWeirdly, yes. Because it’s super similar to the oils our own skin makes. It absorbs like it belongs there. My face thinks it’s getting a top-up of its own stuff, not some foreign substance. So it doesn’t freak out and get clogged or angry.\n\n**Does tallow balm clog pores?**\nNot for me, and I’m pretty prone to clogging. It’s non-comedogenic, which is a fancy way of saying it shouldn’t clog pores. It melts in and feeds your skin, it doesn’t just sit there and block things up like some heavy lotions can.\n\n**What does the lavender tallow balm smell like?**\nReal lavender. Not perfume lavender. It smells like the dried herb bundles you sometimes see at a farmer’s market. Earthy, herbal, a little bit green. It’s strong when you open the jar but once it’s on your skin it mellows out fast into this soft, relaxing scent. It’s the main reason I use it at night.\n\nAnyway. If your skin is being difficult, or dry, or just fussy… might be worth a shot. It’s one of those things that sounds too simple to work. But sometimes, simple is what we’ve been missing. I got mine from Mt. Heritage on Etsy. My hands are proof.",
